That is enough to power over half a million homes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/owcltd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OWC<\/a>\u2019s scope of work awarded to date is to provide electrical, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) and power systems support to the offshore wind development. The company has not disclosed the value of the agreement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work will be led by OWC\u2019s electrical team lead and US country manager Jeff Fodiak who has worked as an electrical engineering consultant in offshore wind since 2008, specialising in the electrical design, grid connection, and general engineering of offshore wind farms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cEfficient power systems are key to harnessing and capitalizing fully the power developed from offshore wind. OWC helps developers optimize transmission costs and ensure the electrical system is technically feasible. This increases the return on investment from each kilowatt of electricity produced,\u201d<\/em> says Jeff Fodiak, OWC\u2019s US country manager and head of grid and electrical services for the wider OWC business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its inception in 2011, OWC has been involved in a total of 58 GW of offshore wind projects worldwide. This constitutes a quarter of the world\u2019s offshore wind capacity by 2030.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OWC is an independent technical advisor, engineering, and project management consultancy to the offshore renewables sector.

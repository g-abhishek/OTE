This is the tenth country the company enters since starting operations just over a year ago. <\/strong><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>\u201cMexico has a significant shallow water oil and gas industry which we already provide some support to. Additionally, the Mexican government\u2019s new energy reform bill is likely to inject new investment into the industry,\u201d says Dr Bader Diab, director \u2013 North America, AqualisBraemar.<\/p>\n<p>Diab believes that the recent approval by Mexico\u2019s Congress of the energy reform bill, which opens up the oil and gas sector to private investment for the first time in 75 years, will attract significant investment from foreign service providers and international E&amp;P companies.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar will this month also establish an operations office in Ciudad del Carmen to support offshore rig owners and oil service companies operating in the coastal city. The company aims to provide support to well-established Mexican rig operators as well as the growing number of new rig owners and new entrants in the Mexican market. Offshore engineering services will also be established in Mexico in due course.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have master service agreements with many major international drilling rig operators and some international E&amp;P companies. We want to be able to support them from day one when offshore assets arrive in Mexico,\u201d says Diab.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar will initially focus on marine operations such as rig moving, mooring installation, dynamic positioning consultancy, marine warranty and routine marine surveys. Services will expand to include rig construction supervision, engineering for jackup conversions and upgrades, as well as offshore platform installation consultancy. AqualisBraemar Mexico will also work closely with the Houston operation and draw on their expertise and human resources where required.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar, which started operations in 2013, has also set up offices in London, UK (HQ); Sandefjord, Kristiansund and Oslo, Norway; Houston, USA; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Singapore; Shanghai, China; Abu Dhabi and Dubai, UAE; Bahrain; and Dammam, Saudi Arabia.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar is a specialized marine and offshore engineering consultancy focusing on the shallow and deep-water offshore segments of the oil and gas industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>8 September 2014 \u2013 Rapidly growing offshore marine and engineering consultancy AqualisBraemar opens an office in Mexico City, Mexico.

Mathew is a Master Mariner of 39 years and is now an expert Tow Master and Marine Warranty Surveyor based in our Dubai office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the 17th of March, COVID-19 was gathering headlines all over the globe. Mathew was following our newly developed and rolled-out safety guidelines when he ventured to the airport that day. Little did he know that when he departed for Mumbai as tow master for a normal season India rig move that he would be experiencing his own \u2018Odyssey\u2019 over the next four months. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masks and health screenings aside, this was not a rare trip for Mathew. AqualisBraemar assists the move of a large percentage of rigs offshore India. This year, <a href=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/news\/despite-covid-19-ongc-successfully-moves-33-drilling-rigs-in-pre-monsoon-rush\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AqualisBraemar moved 33 rigs contracted to for ONGC<\/a> alone, a total of 1,900 nautical miles before the monsoon season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathew arrived in Mumbai, undertook the required health screening and was cleared to travel, and on the 22nd of March, reported at the Mumbai Helibase to join the rig. However, this is where he hit his first challenge. The client\u2019s COVID doctor at the Helibase turned him back and instructed him to quarantine for 14 days from the date of his arrival in India, causing him to miss the tow. We managed to replace Mathew with another tow master who was still offshore; the benefits of a global footprint!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things were moving fast that week as countries all over the world first started going into lockdown, one after another. On the 22nd it was Mumbai\u2019s turn and as Mathew checked into the Hotel Leela, his usual hotel the Sun &amp; Sands were already turning away guests. While Mathew spent the next seven days under the client required quarantine, India went into a three-week lockdown period. Mathew was still delivering for clients, assisting his Dubai office with documentation and Certificates of Approval (CoAs) for client rigs off the west coast of India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the 30th of March, he was nominated for a rig move off the east coast of India. Between then and the 8th of April, while awaiting travel details for this assignment, Mathew continued to work on paperwork for his client\u2019s rigs off the west coast from his hotel room. Word came through at last and Mathew was delighted to be boarding a charter flight to Rajahmundry. He checked in to the River Bay Hotel with a view that, at last, he had the chance to attend site to do what he does best; safely and efficiently move rigs around the ocean. After a further delay, he boarded the rig on the 17th of April after another medical screening at Rajahmundry Airport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A month had now past since Mathew left his home and family but, at last, he was attending a rig move. Both Mathew and his line manager believed that, though the COVID situation continued, conditions would ease over the following month or so and he would get home after this move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the 17th and 30th of April, the rig was successfully moved, deploying and retrieving anchors at both the platforms. After spending another three weeks in Rajahmundry on the project waiting for the necessary clearance to travel, Mathew travelled by road to Bangalore on the 21st of May.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this uncertain and frustrating period, Mathew and his line manager realised the situation was not going to ease and made the start of a number of determined efforts to get him home. Mathew initially spent this in-between time in hotel quarantine in Bangalore, and then his own residence in the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was at this time, now three months away from home, that Mathew volunteered to do one last job back on the east coast. Indeed, if he had not made himself available, the client and the oil company would either have had to accept that at worst their rig could not be moved, or at best would have cost significantly more due to the demand of the very few people in India capable of moving this type of rig. So, on the 20th of June, Mathew boarded a flight to Rajahmundry via Hyderabad and checked into the River Bay Hotel. He boarded the rig on the 29th of June after his now familiar mandatory seven days of quarantine, COVID test and medical screening. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathew spent most of July on the rig manoeuvring between the platforms in stages due to the complexity of the move in deteriorating weather conditions. Then, on the 26th of July, he returned to the River Bay Hotel. During the final rig move, the Dubai travel team had planned his return home; the end of Mathew\u2019s odyssey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12787\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/v-a-mathews-odyssey\/attachment\/va_mathew_and_family\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1043,816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"VA_Mathew_and_family\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-300x235.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-1024x801.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"801\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-1024x801.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12787\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-1024x801.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-300x235.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-768x601.jpg 768w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-187x146.jpg 187w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-50x39.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-96x75.jpg 96w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-960x750.jpg 960w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family-614x480.jpg 614w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VA_Mathew_and_family.jpg 1043w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>V.A.

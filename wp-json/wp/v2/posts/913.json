The maximum number of shares which can be offered to an employee annually under a Performance Award ranges from 500 to 10\u00a0000, depending on the employee&#8217;s job grade at the time of the offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All shares purchased under the share scheme are subject to a lock-up period of two years from the day the shares are transferred to the scheme participants&#8217; VPS accounts. Under the scheme, participants will normally be offered a discount of 20 percent to the average market price. Offers under the scheme will be made once a year, ordinarily at the beginning of May; however, in 2015 offers will be made in June.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The scheme aims to recognize that the services of staff are important to the development, growth and success of both Aqualis and its customers, and ultimately contribute towards creating shareholder value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shares to be issued under the scheme may be made available from authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased by Aqualis ASA on the open market or otherwise. Implementation of the scheme is subject to approval of an increased share authorization for the scheme at the upcoming Annual General Meeting in May.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"20 April 2015 -

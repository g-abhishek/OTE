I began working in the oil and gas sector and made the very definite choice to move to the offshore wind sector due to a desire to do something \u201cgood\u201d for the world and contribute to the clean energy transition. This is something I have in common with a large number of my colleagues \u2013 almost all work in our industry because, like me, they really believe that they\u2019re making a difference. Having a sense of purpose has really helped to motivate me \u2013 and so I try to make sure that everyone I work with has the opportunity to work towards something which matters to them. It\u2019s something we\u2019re all passionate about in AqualisBraemar with our passion for energy and our oceans as well as our commitment to the UN Global Compact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it also wouldn\u2019t be International Women in Engineering Day without also thinking about how making a difference to women\u2019s careers can make a difference to \u2018shaping the world\u2019. I truly believe that by giving women and girls the opportunity to excel in engineering that we can develop a generation of female (and male) engineers who will have a positive impact on our society. As an industry, offshore wind is by no means the worst for gender balance and opportunity, but we still have a long way to go. We can all play our part in improving this, however large or small our actions are \u2014 whether it\u2019s a supportive conversation with a young woman who\u2019s thinking about a career in engineering or changing your company\u2019s policies. I hope I lead by example and that the policies we\u2019ve implemented at AqualisBraemar will have a positive impact on our team but also influence others to make changes too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 has been a year of extraordinary challenges. Although our professional and personal lives have seen great upheaval, this is also a wonderful opportunity to make positive and lasting changes to the way we work \u2014 and indeed this is what we\u2019re planning to do \u2014 from flexible working arrangements to a reduction in travel to reduce our carbon footprint. For me though, the biggest change of 2020 is the arrival of my son in May, so for the rest of the year I\u2019ll be tackling an entirely different challenge (and making the most of AqualisBraemar\u2019s maternity leave policy), but I hope to shape the world in a small way!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you\u2019re doing on this rather strange International Women in Engineering Day I hope you\u2019re all managing to \u2018shape the world\u2019 in your own way, however large or small.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Katherine Phillips, OWC director and UK country manager, is a chartered civil engineer with extensive experience in design, construction and operation of offshore structures in the energy industry including proven technical, management and project management skills.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":11991,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[251],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Katherine-Phillips-edit.jpg","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

I have been in my role for over 11 years and have been client-facing as well as an internal sounding board for our staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years my role has covered a number of areas from operational processes, office management for our head office in London (so overseeing suppliers\/relocations\/refurbishments), company events internally and externally, HR (maintaining policy and procedures, personnel data, contracts etc.) and marketing elements. It is a varied role which has expanded my skill set widely. I work with the rest of the senior management team to help implement new procedures and work on new business strategies. I also sit on the Lillehammer Energy Claims Committee within the Energy Insurance Market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess it is more about my role than the industry itself. I have always been dedicated to my role, and I like being busy and making a difference. The well-being of the staff is a key point for me, I enjoy training and expanding the skill sets of the team around me. I have hosted many events in the past and feel a sense of achievement in delivering these to both staff and clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked in the insurance industry from a very young age, and after about 8 years I decided to take a year out and set off on a trip by myself around the world. It was a fantastic experience but when I returned I was adamant I was not going to end up back in insurance (events was always my passion). However, I was approached to take a job with the company (known as Braemar Steege back then) as a personal assistant but only on a 3-month contract to get my feet back on the ground. But as you can see, after putting my organisational skills to good use and working very hard over the years to be in my position today, I still remain with the company. I have been lucky to work with fantastic colleagues along the way and a great client base which has made the journey so much easier. The fact that my role is so varied keeps every day interesting. There always seems to be a new project to concentrate on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I am not working, I like to spend time with my family. I love to travel and explore new places with my fianc\u00e9, however entertaining and bringing up three small children certainly keeps us on our toes. We like watching F1 and our aim is to get to as many tracks as possible overseas. If I ever get the chance I like to curl up with a good book; I love history and crime.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cI am the Group Operations Director, which entails an HR element for the group.

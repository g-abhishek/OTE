While primarily focused in the hull and machinery sector, I also attend to shipyard risk assessment surveys, marine warranty surveys, towage approvals, vessel condition surveys and casualty attendance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The broader maritime industry is constantly evolving, whether it be technological development, demands for greater efficiencies (environmentally and operationally), or adaptation to circumstance. This demands that surveyors constantly growing their knowledge base and skillset as a standard of continuous development. This is a great challenge and keeps things interesting &#8211; never an opportunity for complacency or boredom! &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating in the Sub Saharan region brings with it unique challenges, and we have entered an exciting era of development in the offshore Oil and Gas sector within the region. I am pleased to work for a dynamic company committed to being part of the growth plan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I work with a highly skilled and diverse group of specialists as well as phenomenal administrative support team who make it possible for us to hit the ground running as cases and projects present themselves. The prevailing work ethic is that no one is above rolling their sleeves up to get the job done \u2013 literally or figuratively. We support each other, and in doing so, we support the interests of our clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Challenge, diversity and a great working environmen; hard not to feel excited!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a joint decision between my heart and head. The opportunity to work with such a reputable company and engage with colleagues who share such a broad spectrum of expertise is a \u201conce in a career\u201d opportunity. My heart shared a vote on the basis that \u201c<em>opportunities are often lost as they are dressed in coveralls and look like work\u201d.&nbsp;<\/em>Trading a desk for more shared time in coveralls in the field had a distinct appeal. It is a career which offers the best of both worlds &#8211; a corner office of sorts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My time is well divided between caring for my motley crew of pets and enjoying the outdoors. I support wildlife rehabilitation programs and, when time allows, a campsite in the bushveld is the place to be. I have a keen interest in adult literacy programs and hope to retire to teaching in this field in the years to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The team at AqualisBraemar share the passion, vision and values for working in energy and the world\u2019s oceans, de-risking and driving the energy transition.

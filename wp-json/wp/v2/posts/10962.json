According to the same report, this figure could grow to between 164 and 200 GW installed capacity by 2030.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>The 50 GW project track record is proud milestone for us which proves that we have become one of the world\u2019s favoured consultancies for owners and developers of offshore wind farms,\u201d<\/em> adds Cleverly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent EIC report also raises concerns about the supply chain\u2019s ability to meet global demand, particularly for vessels, skilled labour and fabrication shipyards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cChoosing the optimal wind farm design will help reduce costs and labour intensity.

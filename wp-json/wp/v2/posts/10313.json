The acquisition of Braemar Technical Services roughly doubled the size of the company and improved our offering to our clients, who now benefit from a broader suite of services and increased geographical footprint. The transaction was also an important step forward to consolidate our industry. The integration is on track and progressing well quarter by quarter.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>OWC, our renewables arm, had a strong year delivering annual organic revenue growth of 46%. We continue to see increasing demand for OWC\u2019s expertise and anticipate continued high growth in 2020, albeit at a lower rate than 2019.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>In the fourth quarter, we saw improvements across most segments. Middle East and Americas delivered the highest sequential growth in revenue and EBIT, primarily driven by increased offshore activity.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The year has started positively across our businesses, but tail risk has increased due to COVID-19 and potential impact on economic activity. Activity in China will be significantly affected in the first half of the year.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Finally, we are happy to announce that the Board has proposed resuming dividend payments on a new semi-annual schedule.

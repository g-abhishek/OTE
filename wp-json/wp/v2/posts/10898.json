My work time is split 50\/50 between business development tasks and site-based inspections primarily for oil companies and drilling rig owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my career, I spent 20 years sailing onboard merchant vessels, mostly involved in offshore oil and gas projects, and for the last 10 years I have been focussed on assurance and compliance of drilling rigs and offshore vessels. These days not only am I involved in offshore assurance projects but also with expert witness cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the variety of the work, rarely are two rigs or vessels identical \u2013 yes there are vessel or rig types, but each has its own unique systems and idiosyncrasies. Rarely are we faced with the exact same scope of work or project deliverable. This is very challenging, but also very rewarding when we have met all our client\u2019s deliverables and see them continue to meet their targets and goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my current role, I truly get involved with projects through the full project cycle, from those initial business development meetings presented in clients&#8217; offices, through to winning contracts and then through the entire project delivery phase. It is very rewarding when clients return to you for repeat work. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Made you Join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I had previously worked for a small consultancy business and within that structure opportunities and innovation were limited, so when I joined AqualisBraemar or Aqualis Offshore as it was then, I was trusted by the company\u2019s executive management to develop and run a global business line of Rig Inspection Services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forward-thinking approach and global support network within the company were one of the main reasons for joining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My two main sporting passions are playing Badminton and golf, of which the latter I rarely find time for. I enjoy watching F1 (the engineer in me loves the geekiness of it). We have a caravan in the Lake District and taking the dog for long walks (strangely in the rain) when we are over there is what I find most relaxing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During my career, I spent 20 years sailing onboard merchant vessels, mostly involved in offshore oil and gas projects, and for the last 10 years I have been focussed on assurance and compliance of drilling rigs and offshore vessels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[251],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

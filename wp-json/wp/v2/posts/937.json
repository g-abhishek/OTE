Order backlog stood at USD 22 million at the\u00a0end of the third quarter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We continue our geographical expansion as well as growth in revenues and\u00a0consultants. We signed important contracts and frame agreements during the\u00a0quarter, and were successfully listed as a fully-fledged marine and offshore\u00a0engineering group. Our order book also developed positively. In sum, it has been\u00a0a solid and eventful quarter,&#8221; says David Wells, CEO of Aqualis ASA.<\/p>\n<p>Operating revenues were USD 10.7 million in the third quarter of 2014.

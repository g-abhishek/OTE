We provide extensive engineering and technical experience from offshore wind farm developments, coupled with understanding the specific regulatory framework that developers need to adhere to. This facilitates a service that considers all technical project requirements and constraints when defining an appropriate project permitting scope and execution strategy,\u201d <\/em>says John MacAskill, business development director at OWC. <em>\u201cThis local experience is supported by a global team of offshore wind experts ensuring that the specific nature of offshore wind development and project realisation is part of the solution we provide clients.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the US offshore wind market drives forward, the industry still faces several challenges with respect to the regulatory and permitting requirements. Projects will need to pay special attention to detail and process when it comes to individual state and regional planning and permitting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, several recent directives have been put forth to reduce both the amount of information needed to support the review and the timelines themselves. Developers will also need to monitor for potential bottlenecks at agency level as a consequence of increased demand for agency resources and staff from other projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cSimply explained, we will help developers understand how these processes may affect project schedules\u201d<\/em> says Adrienne Fink, who heads up OWC\u2019s office in Boston, USA . <em>\u201cOn the other side, we will help improve regulators comfort level in making well-informed assessments and providing necessary approvals.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the best possible planning and forward thinking approach, developers can ensure that agency reviews go smoothly by providing the right level of detail to facilitate the review and the desired decision, but also reduce redundancy or requests for additional information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cHaving the support of an experienced US regulatory team to guide a developer through the process and advocate for appropriate levels of review and mitigation will be an important part to the industry\u2019s continued success as we build confidence and trust with regulators. OWC looks forward to its involvement and contributions to this exciting industry. Building on our regulatory and permitting team in Taiwan, another renewables emerging market, it is OWC\u2019s objective to offer expert regulatory advisory specialising in all emerging markets,\u201d<\/em> Fink adds.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OWC, which is part of Oslo-listed energy consultancy group Aqualis ASA, is an independent engineering consultancy focused on the development and realisation of offshore renewables technology and projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nKim Boman, CFO, Aqualis ASA<br>\nTelephone: +47 959 63 912<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:kim.boman@aqualis.no\">kim.boman@aqualis.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nEndre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: +47 41 61 06 05<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>About Aqualis ASA<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nAqualis ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public company that, through its subsidiaries and associates, offers energy consultancy services to the offshore oil, gas and renewables sectors globally.

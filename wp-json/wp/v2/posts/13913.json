You know AqualisBraemar, but do you know our team?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-anjar-ciptandini-senior-adjuster-dubai\">Anjar Ciptandini, Senior Adjuster | Dubai<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-do-you-do-at-aqualisbraemar\">What do you do at AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a Senior Adjuster in the Dubai office. My regular day job is to investigate and report on insurance claims in the energy, marine, and power sectors. These incidents and claims are typically complex and of high value.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having graduated with a naval architecture degree, my professional career extended to include exposure to the oil and gas sector. In line with my background, my initial assignments were related to marine or offshore type energy claims. However, as I gained experience and confidence, this list grew to include a variety of other disciplines. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My career in loss adjusting came to a pause when I joined a middle-east based reinsurer as a Facultative Claims Manager. During this period, I oversaw multiple major and complex claims, some of which were in excess of USD 1 Billion and was exposed to various other lines of businesses, including cargo, aviation, engineering, property, liability, and specialty lines. My regional exposure included the Middle East and North Africa, the Mediterranean, Central Asia, Indian Subcontinents, South East Asia, and the Far East regions. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since rejoining AqualisBraemar, I have been actively engaged in a wide array of claims involving ports and harbours, fertiliser plants, power plants, onshore rigs, and other energy-related claims, both offshore and onshore. My role may require attendance on-site to review damage or ongoing repairs. In the office, I spend most of my time reviewing technical documents, evaluating and allocating damage repair costs against policy conditions. This work is then packaged for (Re)insurers in the form of detailed written reports which allow claims to be settled as promptly as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-excites-you-the-most-about-our-industry\">What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As an engineer, technology excites me. The losses I\u2019ve handled involve some of the world\u2019s most complex engineering feats, of which I previously only got to experience through reading engineering journals. To actually get to see these feats in person is breathtaking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As my experience grows, I\u2019ve come to realise that it takes a whole lot more than just technical proficiency to become a well-rounded adjuster. In a major and complex claim scenario, each of the stakeholders of the insurance contract may have different objectives, and managing them can sometimes feel like herding cats. The clients might be global blue-chip or state-owned companies, so there is always a little bit of bureaucracy and politics in play. The ultimate goal of my profession is to bring everyone together to adhere to the agreed insurance policy\u2019s terms and conditions to reach an amicable resolution to a claim. We need to keep ourselves independent and impartial while examining facts. Once we\u2019ve completed our thorough investigations and discuss the policy&#8217;s application with (Re)insurers, we need to let everyone know the outcome of our findings. We then need to tell the clients whether or not the loss is recoverable from the insurance policy. This would mean telling the clients the \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 news. I cannot always give them the news that they want to hear, but after explaining our position and listening to others\u2019 points of view, agreement is usually possible. The key is to keep our investigations fair and transparent, maintaining the discussions on track whilst managing the level of clients\u2019 expectations in parallel. Helping people reach an equitable settlement and get back on track after a loss gives me much satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-made-you-join-aqualisbraemar\">What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before becoming an adjuster, I was an \u2018on-call\u2019 field\/project engineer. This meant that I spent most of my time travelling to and fro and working on project sites, whether offshore, onshore or in the middle of nowhere. I often stayed at these remote sites for prolonged periods. Whilst these field assignments helped me to grow as an engineer and were highly rewarding, the prolonged periods on-site meant I had to miss many important family and friends\u2019 events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to energy loss adjusting still requires me to be on-call, but visits to site are typically shorter. It has also allowed me to maintain one foot in the industry that I enjoy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-do-you-do-when-you-are-not-working\">What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a father of two young children and love spending my time with family. I enjoy watching my children grow, being their best friend and sharing some life lessons with them. I am fond of gardening and spend much of my time in my backyard. Living in the Middle East means I have to put a bit of extra effort to keep my plants healthy and strong. &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The team at AqualisBraemar shares the passion, vision and values for working in energy and the world\u2019s oceans, de-risking and driving the energy transition.

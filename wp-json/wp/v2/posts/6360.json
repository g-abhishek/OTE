Unfortunately, that may mean that a dollar saved 3 years ago has cost 10 dollars today \u2013 and for companies who survived through those years, they will no doubt feel justified in their approach.<\/p>\n<p>The types of strategies that I refer to when talking about reactivation are what could be considered as consumables. These include items such as:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bullets\">\n<li>Hydraulic hoses<\/li>\n<li>Lifting wires<\/li>\n<li>Bearings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We have seen varying approaches to items like these, with some owners considering them as disposable upon reactivation and not spending money or effort to preserve them. Other owners remove or make efforts to preserve these types of equipment and then test and establish them back into service during reactivations.<\/p>\n<p>One of the particularly often overlooked items is the removal of drilling lines, which if not removed has a number of consequences:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Brinelling or flat spotting of bearings on crown clusters<\/li>\n<li>Brinelling or flat spotting of bearings on travelling blocks<\/li>\n<li>Brinelling or flat spotting of bearings on draw works<\/li>\n<li>Exposed wire corroding<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Again, it can be argued that if the reactivation plan includes renewal of wires and overhauls of the equipment then wires and bearings will be replaced as part of that reactivation exercise. Had the wire simply been unreeved then potentially some expensive overhaul work could have been avoided, if the preservation fell within 5 yearly overhaul periods.<\/p>\n<p>During a preservation inspection, a rig inspection team will mainly consider what the Original Equipment Manufacturer&#8217;s long-storage preservation recommendations are, what preservation maintenance is recommended and then compare these against each other.<\/p>\n<p>It is repeatedly seen within the industry that different approaches have been taken to the same objective. This is primarily driven by upfront cost against back-end costs.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"6362\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/preservation-inspections\/attachment\/left\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Left\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left-300x225.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6362 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left-195x146.jpg 195w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left-50x38.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left-100x75.jpg 100w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Left.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/> <img data-attachment-id=\"6361\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/preservation-inspections\/attachment\/right\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Right\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right-300x225.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6361 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right-195x146.jpg 195w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right-50x38.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right-100x75.jpg 100w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Right.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the example above, the photo on the left has been fully enclosed within UV protective material.

Aqualis Offshore contests the charges. \u00d8kokrim has also advised that it will raise the fine to NOK 2.0 million if Aqualis Offshore rejects the fine and the case is brought to court. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The penalty charge relates to a marine warranty survey conducted by Aqualis Offshore in 2017 on the vessel Tide Carrier in Kvinnherad, Norway. Prior to its departure, whilst crew were reportedly undertaking some anciliary equipment overhauls, the vessel dragged its anchor during the onset of a storm and was subsequently towed to Gismarvik quay where it was placed under arrest. After investigation, \u00d8kokrim charged and fined the vessel\u2019s commercial manager for attempting to illegally export hazardous waste to Pakistan. In issuing the penalty charge notice to Aqualis Offshore, \u00d8kokrim claims that Aqualis Offshore aided this attempt. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aqualis Offshore strongly opposes \u00d8kokrim\u2019s assessment of its role in the case. As an independent technical surveyor, Aqualis Offshore is not involved with decisions about where shipowners trade their vessels nor is responsible for ensuring shipowners comply with their legal obligations. With this penalty charge notice, \u00d8kokrim attempts to hold Aqualis Offshore legally accountable for destination decisions and processes that are outside the company\u2019s influence and control. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201c\u00d8kokrim\u2019s charge against Aqualis Offshore can be compared with trying to hold a licensed automotive workshop responsible for where a car owner decides to drive their car following the completion of a periodic motor vehicle inspection (EU control\/MOT test),\u201d <\/em>says CEO David Wells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aqualis Offshore believes that a full court hearing will prove that the company acted diligently in connection with the company\u2019s marine warranty assignment, and that \u00d8kokrim is trying to hold Aqualis Offshore legally accountable for matters the company has no influence over. As the case will now go to court, further comments on this matter will currently not be provided.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nKim Boman, CFO, AqualisBraemar ASA<br>\nTelephone: +47 959 63 912<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nEndre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: +47 41 61 06 05<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar ASA<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nAqualisBraemar ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public listed company that, through its subsidiaries and associates, offers adjusting, marine, offshore and renewables consultancy services to the energy, shipping and insurance industries.

We believe a local presence is central to leveraging our global expertise and providing the best possible local support to wind farm developers,\u201d<\/em> says Will Cleverly, managing director of OWC, an independent technical advisor, engineering and project management consultancy to the offshore renewables sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The South Korean government has announced that it aims to reach 30-35% renewables in its energy mix by 2040. This translates to installing almost 130GW of renewable energy by 2040, compared to current capacity of around 11.3GW.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cOffshore wind is not a major energy source in South Korea today, but we see huge opportunities within both fixed and floating offshore wind installations. Our presence here reflects our ambitions to support the country\u2019s green energy drive,\u201d <\/em>adds Cleverly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/owcltd.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/NJ-Park-long.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1943\" width=\"250\" height=\"376\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Country manager appointed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OWC has appointed highly experienced Noh Joon \u201cNJ\u201d Park to head up its operation in South Korea, based out of Seoul.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Park joins OWC from sister company AqualisBraemar\u2019s Singapore office, where he has held a project director role for the past six years.

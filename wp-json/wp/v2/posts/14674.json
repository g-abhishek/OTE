I have recently led the Thailand team in decommissioning of fixed offshore platforms (reefing of jacket), FPSO replacements in both Thailand and Myanmar, and ocean marine transportation of project cargo. Our clients are very supportive of the new greener energy industries and are looking to invest in renewables projects; our office in Thailand has been engaged to handle fuel cell land transportation and a hydro-floating solar hybrid development project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the project mentioned above, I am currently managing our talented MWS team in Thailand to decommission 28 platforms, install 16 new platforms in 2021 and move 4 jack-up rigs in the Gulf of Thailand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to day-to-day operations, I am also exploring new markets to assist the regional marine team in expanding our capabilities to Post Lost business and helping to grow our footprint in a nearby country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-excites-you-the-most-about-our-industry\">What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting part of working in this industry is participating in highly challenging projects.

I hope my position will also enable me to enhance safety standards in this country by applying our company standards and guidelines wherever and whenever I can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-do-you-do-when-you-are-not-working\">What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In my free time, I enjoy windsurfing, drumming and running.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am the Thailand Country Manager based in Thailand, and I am responsible for the day-to-day operations and project quality control, as well as office commercial aspects. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[251],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

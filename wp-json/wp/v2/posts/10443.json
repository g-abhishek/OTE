Our hearts and thoughts go out to those who have been affected and we appreciate the public health workers, activists and helpers in local communities and government workers around the world who are on the frontline working to contain this virus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AqualisBraemar is a global consultancy working in energy and the world\u2019s oceans and, like all companies, the health crisis is impacting us as an organisation as well as the sectors we serve. Our overriding priority is the health of our staff and their families, our customers and the wider communities in which we serve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we are maintaining our full operational capabilities where we can. We can travel to service the required attendances as long as it complies with our internal emergency governance. Our comprehensive global footprint allows us to serve local and regional clients as flexibly as possible at this time. When we do, we prioritise staff, client and wider public health requirements&nbsp;in line with WHO and other international government guidelines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this difficult time, many of our office-based staff across the globe will be working remotely in line with local recommendations. We will continue working on deliverables and increase the number of virtual meetings with clients as needed through our robust IT system to ensure we do all we can to arrest the spread of the virus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ask our customers for a degree of patience and understanding. We will do our best within the circumstances, while putting health and safety first, to attend as soon as possible within the guidelines of the specific national restrictions in place. However, we have a considerable&nbsp;global footprint&nbsp;of marine engineers and master mariners, which makes attendance more possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our staff can always be reached via their regular business mobile phone number and\/or email address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AqualisBraemar will continue to serve its customers wherever they are and to the best of our ability during these difficult times. To ensure we maintain our service levels, our 24\/7 emergency contact number (+44 20 3142 4350) will continue to be manned and our clients are very welcome to contact our personnel directly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is having unprecedented impacts on communities and businesses in many countries around the world&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

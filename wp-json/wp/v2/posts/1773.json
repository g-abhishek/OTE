This followed a market review by Aqualis <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Offshore<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">in Aberdeen which identified that there is a market demand for the marine, transportation and reverse installation engineering skills.

The recent significant drop in the price of oil has meant that more fields will become uneconomic sooner and it is important to make the correct decision as to what should be done with such facilities. For floating facilities disconnecting risers, umbilicals and moorings and then taking the unit under tow is <\/span><span class=\"s2\">relatively<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> straightforward, as long as suitably experienced personnel are engaged.\u00a0 For bottom mounted facilities removal is more complicated and as has been point<\/span><span class=\"s2\">ed<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> out by the Wood Review, may not always be the optimum decision from a UK PLC point of view. This is due to the possible reuse of such infrastructure in the future using either new techniques for oil and gas recovery\/satellite fields or for use with marine renewable energy devices or even for marine life enhancement. The energy balance associated with all decommissioning options should also be taken into account in the decision making process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSince the marine aspects of decommissioning are potentially expensive and high risk, Aqualis <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Offshore <\/span><span class=\"s1\">is keen to make use of DNS to promote our specialist marine expertise to a much wider audience,\u201d commented Aqualis <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Offshore\u2019s <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Aberdeen\u2019s General Manager, Martin Brown.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">For example Aqualis <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Offshore <\/span><span class=\"s1\">will attend DNS\u2019s Offshore Decommissioning Conference from the 17<\/span><span class=\"s4\"><sup>th<\/sup><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> to the 19<\/span><span class=\"s4\"><sup>th<\/sup><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> of November at the Fairmont Hotel in Saint Andrews to establish mutually beneficial contacts with other specialists covering the full range of decommissioning activities.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"AqualisBraemar UK Ltd has joined Decom North Sea (DNS) \u2013 the industry trade body to to promote decommissioning and reuse opportunities throughout the supply chain.

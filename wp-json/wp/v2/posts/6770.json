In the past year OWC has undertaken a number of US assignments and we are receiving an increasing number of service requests from the US. Our clients are increasingly expecting a permanent presence from us, which allows us the opportunity to expand into Boston,\u201d <\/em>says John MacAskill, business development director at OWC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/owcltd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"OWC (opens in a new tab)\">OWC<\/a> is an independent engineering consultancy focused on the development and realisation of offshore renewables technology and projects. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OWC has been involved in several US offshore wind projects to date, leveraging on the office of its sister company, AqualisBraemar, in Houston, Texas. As an example, AqualisBraemar has provided geotechnical site investigation supervision services at \u00d8rsted\u2019s Ocean Wind offshore wind farm. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cBoston is increasingly becoming the centre for offshore wind developments in the US. We aim to support projects at both early stage and as they work through to realisation, mixing our global wind experience with local knowledge and expertise. We will also continue to capitalise on AqualisBraemar US offshore sector competence,\u201d<\/em> adds MacAskill. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of this initiative OWC has recruited Adrienne Fink who will lead this new Boston based team. Adrienne has worked as an environmental and regulatory consultant with over 20 years of experience in the US energy sectors in the onshore, coastal, and marine infrastructure markets. Adrienne was an early adopter and supporter of US offshore wind, involved with the MMS reorganisation and development of BOEMRE (now BOEM) and interim Rule Guidance development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI am very excited to be joining OWC to lead the new Boston office to serve the US market\u201d, <\/em>says Adrienne. <em>\u201cThis is the second new OWC office to open within the last eight months and I look forward to supporting OWC\u2019s continued growth during 2019 and beyond\u201d. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OWC is part of Oslo-listed Aqualis ASA, an energy consulting group providing consultancy services to the offshore renewables, oil and gas as well as the maritime and shipping industries globally. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nKim Boman, CFO, Aqualis ASA<br>\nTelephone: +47 959 63 912<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:kim.boman@aqualis.no\">kim.boman@aqualis.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nEndre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: +47 41 61 06 05<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>About Aqualis ASA<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nAqualis ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public company that, through its subsidiaries and associates, offers energy consultancy services to the offshore oil, gas and renewables sectors globally.

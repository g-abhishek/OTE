We are driven by the idea that the best work is born from professionalism, diligence\u2026 and fun. You know AqualisBraemar, but do you know our team?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Andy Ritchie, Marine Operations Manager | Aberdeen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do at AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am the Marine Operations Manager for AqualisBraemar, based in Aberdeen. My main role in the office is to project manage the services we provide in Europe. I also enjoy getting out of the office to meet clients and potential clients face-to-face, promoting the wide range of different services we offer from MWS, rig moving, marine reps, single voyages, engineering consultancy, marine consultancy and hands-on vessel inspections and suitability surveys. This part of my role takes me to different countries all around the world. During my working career, which started in 1978, I have always been involved in the maritime industry, starting as a trainee deckhand moving through the ranks to master then to ship inspector\/auditor then fleet operations manager and to the role that I am now thoroughly enjoying. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day is different; there is not a day goes by without a new challenge appearing before me. With over 40 years\u2019 experience in the industry, I still see every day as a learning day. Working with a great team of industry-proven professionals provides me with all the knowledge and expertise I require to undertake my role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AqualisBraemar has a huge global footprint with offices in every continent and being able to globally provide our clients with a service that is second to none excites me greatly. During my working day, I could be discussing business\/proposals\/projects with my colleagues in Singapore, Shanghai, Perth, Rio de Janeiro, Houston, New York, Dubai, Doha or London to name but a few of our offices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was approached to join AqualisBraemar in October 2019 and started in November. From the initial interview to the day I walked through the door everything was undertaken in a professional manner. I walked in on day one and hit the ground running, IT set up, phone set up, business cards ready to go. The attraction to join was the variety of work that I would be involved in, not only locally but globally. The new challenge of different work scopes and project types was something that attracted me to the AqualisBraemar family, and to date I have not been disappointed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the projects I was involved in was the transport of the \u201cGolden Bridge\u201d for the Slussen infrastructure project in Stockholm, Sweden. This is one of the country\u2019s largest construction projects. Our team in China was responsible for the loading of the 3500-tonne bridge and our team based here in the UK was responsible for the offload in Stockholm after the bridge had been transported over 20,333 kilometres on the HLV Zhen Hua 33.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have made it my goal that when the project has been completed in Stockholm I would like to go and visit the area and to see the finished product for myself, knowing that I had a part in successfully achieving the transportation of the bridge from China to Sweden.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend time with my family and friends. My wife and I have a new grandson who was born on March 8<sup>th<\/sup> and due to the current circumstances, we have been distanced from him, so our daily routine is FaceTiming and catching up on his development. We are so looking forward to giving him lots of cuddles, hopefully soon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The team at AqualisBraemar share the passion, vision and values for working in energy and the world\u2019s oceans, de-risking and driving the energy transition.

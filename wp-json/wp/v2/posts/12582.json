This resulted in significant savings (greater than \u00a34.0m) for the project. OWC has since delivered work and completed numerous other roles on the project, and are still adding value today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work and roles have included the aforementioned geotechnical and structural engineering, cable route design, OFTO package management, construction readiness assessment, senior O&amp;M engineer, senior foundation project manager, installation manager, technical support engineer, onshore site administrators, electrical site manager, Belfast foundation fabrication and QC team, ONSS supply and installation project manager, document management, environmental site advisor and structural inspections among other roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cCongratulations to our friends at ScottishPower Renewables and Iberdrola for their incredible achievement.\u201d <\/em>Said Will Cleverly, OWC managing director. <em>\u201cEast Anglia ONE was my first project at OWC, and one I look back on with great fondness. We followed it from Great Yarmouth to Dubai, to China, to the titanic yards of Harland and Woolf.

Were you inspired by someone?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was young, I was passionate about Formula 1. The first time I heard the word \u2018Engineer\u2019 was while watching F1, and I thought \u201cI want to be an engineer because I want to fix things\u201d. Later, I realised that I had the skills that would fit perfectly with a career in Engineering and that I could not only fix but also create things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is it like to be a woman in engineering? Do you feel that your gender gives you a different perspective and experience from your male counterparts? Any advantages?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a woman in engineering definitely comes with its challenges. Many times in the work environment, I find myself as the only female working\/teamed up with male colleagues. Sometimes you have to make sure your voice is being heard, but I prefer to believe that I am valued and thought of as an engineer based on merit, not gender. I don\u2019t believe I have had any advantage or disadvantage in my career because I was a woman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you wake up looking forward to? What\u2019s next for your career?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Brazil, we are in the very early stages of developing an Offshore Wind market, but with very good potential. Therefore, I look forward to gaining as much experience as possible in Offshore Wind and hope to be able to work on assisting the growth of this sector in Brazil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How has AqualisBraemar helped you grow?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During my time in AqualisBraemar, I\u2019ve had many great opportunities and experiences. At AqualisBraemar, I always have the opportunity to go on-site and work on many different types of projects, which helps me increase my technical skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a Marine Engineer, I have mostly been working in the Oil and Gas sector. Last year I finished my Master\u2019s degree, where I had the chance to develop a thesis related to Offshore Wind, and OWC offered me the opportunity for a secondment in the London office. It was an incredible experience where I was able to shadow and work closely with the OWC team and got first-hand experience in offshore wind projects.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Luany Dantas is a Naval Architect and Marine Engineer in our Rio de Janeiro office.

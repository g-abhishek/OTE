We have exciting business opportunities ahead with an expanded combined network of 48 offices in 33 countries, an enhanced serviced offering and large pool of talented staff.<\/p><p>It is particularly pleasing that the announcement has been well received by our clients and the market in general which gives us a great foundation from which to build. Our current focus is on bringing the two companies together and realizing synergies from the combination.<\/p><p>Our renewables arm, OWC, has performed very strongly in an increasingly robust, though competitive, market.  Growth opportunities continue to manifest themselves and some good new contract wins have been landed in the consultancy market.<\/p><p>Our performance in the oil and gas market, which continues to gradually stabilize and give indications of improvement, have been a little weaker than we expected driven mainly by marine operations, and new contract awards in general, being delayed for various reasons.<\/p><p>The integration with BTS is proceeding according to plan. We are maintaining a strong focus on serving our clients and expanding our business during the integration phase. We have raised our cost synergy target from USD 1.1 million to USD 2.0 million. The rights issue carried out after the quarter was well received and oversubscribed. <\/p><p>We are excited about the opportunities that lies ahead as a combined company with increasing demand from cyclical recovery in the oil &amp; gas market and the continued expansion of the offshore renewables market.

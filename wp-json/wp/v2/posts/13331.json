I used to be a T&amp;I engineer working on offshore topsides floatovers in Singapore. I have been very lucky to have a fantastic team to support me to explore the opportunities in China since I came back to China in 2014. The China team includes naval architects, structural engineers, master mariners, marine engineers, construction supervisors, business development personnel, finance and document controllers, etc. I am glad to see what we have achieved together over the past years and look forward to more successes with a bigger and stronger team in China as we move forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting thing for me is the people I get to work with in the industry. We are dealing with various people on high-risk operations in the industry, including oil giants, drilling companies, contractors, shipping companies, etc. We help people to solve complex challenges with expertise and experience. Along with the time change, there are always new challenges and changes ahead. The people we work with help us to keep up to date on the changes and challenges in the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People in AqualisBraemar share the same values. I joined because of the people that I had worked with in Singapore since 2007. The team in AqualisBraemar is fantastic. They are knowledgeable and professional. They are willing to help whenever you need any support.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to have some exercises over the weekend, such as jogging, swimming, etc. so that my body is energised. It gets me ready for the next week\u2019s challenges too. Besides, I have many friends in Shanghai, so do my wife and two lovely daughters. We like to go out with friends and their families in Shanghai or nearby cities for weekends sometimes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cI am the country manager of AqualisBraemar China, looking after the business in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":13355,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[251],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Yongfei-Shanghai.jpg","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

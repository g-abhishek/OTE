EBIT was negative USD 1.4 million. The company continued its rapid expansion through opening three new offices in Q3 as well as announcing plans to move into the solar energy sector.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;As guided in our Q2 report, we experienced a slight decrease in revenues in the third quarter, partly because of the effects of monsoon season offshore India. However, the underlying performance of the group remains solid, despite some weak oil and gas segments. In sum, we are operating on a solid platform while continuing to expand both our international presence and service offering,&#8221; says David Wells, CEO of Aqualis ASA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Operating revenues were USD 9.5 million in the third quarter 2015 (Q3 2014: USD 11.3 million). Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) was negative USD 1.4 million (-1 million). Profit after tax was negative USD 1.5 million (-1.2 million). Cash flow in the quarter was negative USD 1.8 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Aqualis&#8217; order backlog from fixed contracts stood at USD 15.1 million at the end of September. This is the same level as the end of the previous quarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Our strategic shift from new-build to the operations segment affects the size of our backlog. However, it is worth remembering that day-to-day service operations are managed by call-out contracts that do not get included in our backlog figures. Our pipeline of work from these types of contract continues to look solid,&#8221; says David Wells.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Aqualis made two major strategic expansion moves during the third quarter. Firstly, the company continued its fast-paced geographical expansion and opened new offices in Germany, Malaysia and South Korea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Secondly, in September Aqualis signed a MoU to acquire a 49.9 percent stake in Adler Solar &#8211; a Germany-based company specialising in the provision of engineering consultancy and testing services for all lifecycle phases of PV plants and PV modules. The transaction is expected to be closed in the fourth quarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Through the acquisition of Adler Solar, Aqualis will achieve its original strategy of operating as &#8220;energy consultants&#8221; across three main sectors: oil and gas (AqualisBraemar), offshore renewables (Offshore Wind Consultants) and solar energy (Adler Solar).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;A key priority going forward is the consolidation of our recent fast-paced footprint growth. There are numerous opportunities within these countries which we aim to capitalise on. We will also continue to monitor possible structural add-on opportunities to enhance value for Aqualis&#8217; shareholders,&#8221; says David Wells.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At 09:00 CET a live webcast with CEO David Wells and CFO Christian Opsahl presenting the Q3 financial results will be available from the following URL: <a href=\"http:\/\/webtv.hegnar.no\/presentation.php?webcastId=25481094\"><span class=\"s2\">http:\/\/webtv.hegnar.no\/presentation.php?webcastId=25481094<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Q3-2015-Report.pdf\">Q3 2015 Report<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Q3-2015-Presentation.pdf\">Q3 2015 Presentation<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"27 October 2015 - Offshore and marine engineering consultancy group Aqualis ASA (Aqualis) reported revenues of USD 9.5 million in the third quarter 2015.

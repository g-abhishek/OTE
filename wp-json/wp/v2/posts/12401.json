Lukasz Sikorski has been appointed manager of the office.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cOffshore wind is growing fast globally and the recent sudden drop in oil prices has fuelled interest in offshore renewables further. Earlier this year the Polish government handed in the offshore wind act that outlines more than 10GW of capacity to be awarded by 2028 into parliament. We want to support the Polish wind industry and create jobs locally by doing so,\u201d<\/em> says Wilhelm Sander, director of OWC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent months, OWC has announced plans to set up offices in Tokyo and Seoul to support the rapidly emerging offshore wind markets in Japan and South Korea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its inception in 2011, OWC has been involved in a total of 50.6 GW of offshore wind projects worldwide. This constitutes a quarter of the world\u2019s offshore wind capacity by 2030. OWC is an independent technical advisor, engineering and project management consultancy to the offshore renewables sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To head up its new office in Warsaw, Poland, OWC has appointed experienced offshore wind consultant Lukasz Sikorski. He has 13 years\u2019 experience, including offshore engineering roles for DNV GL as well as site and project manager roles with Iberdrola. Sikorski is a civil engineer with masters in engineering and master of business administration (MBA).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cLukasz has been involved with a great variety of wind project development work, including construction and operation, feasibility studies and technical reviews of wind farms, due diligence, projects financing and risk evaluations. He is a great asset to any wind farm developer in the Baltic Sea,\u201d<\/em> adds Sander.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:<\/p>\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n<p>Kim Boman, CFO, AqualisBraemar ASA<br>\nTelephone: +47 959 63 912<\/p>\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n<p>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: +47 41 61 06 05<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar ASA<\/h5>\nAqualisBraemar ASA (OSE: Aqua) offers independent consultancy services to the offshore energy (oil &amp; gas and renewables), shipping and insurance industries.

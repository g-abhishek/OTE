Regardless, the business continues to show growth and improved profitability relative to the same period last year. We are delighted to present yet another quarter of record-high cash flow, as our ongoing focus on freeing up working capital is gaining traction. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>OWC, our renewables arm, continues to grow rapidly, delivering organic revenue growth of 105% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Our ambition is for half of our revenues to come from renewables and other ESG driven sources by 2025. We are on track to reach that target, with OWC representing 21% of our revenues in the third quarter, up from 11% in the third quarter of 2019. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see improved activity and utilisation. Despite the continued impact of travel restrictions and cautious client behaviour in many of our markets, the period has started on a positive note with several projects awards and continued strong cash flow. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Finally, we are happy to announce that the Board has proposed and declared an additional dividend of NOK 0.2 per share, to be distributed to shareholders in November. Together with the dividends paid during the second quarter, this brings the total dividend payments for 2020 to NOK 0.4 per share, corresponding to USD 3.0 million cash returned to our shareholders. We remain committed to our strategy of returning capital to our shareholders.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pre-recorded audio webcast presentation of the third quarter 2020 results will be released today at 14:00 CET.

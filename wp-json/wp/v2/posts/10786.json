The COVID-19 situation has not had a significant group-wide impact on AqualisBraemar\u2019s activity level to date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThere have been positives and negatives for us to date. Positively, through our extensive global footprint of staff and subcontractors currently covering almost 160 locations, we have been able to increasingly support new clients at locations where others have been unable to access. Negatively, the increasing global travel restrictions present challenges to us and our clients, increasing complexity in project execution. Our prime focus remains to provide an uninterrupted service to our clients but, in light of the seriousness of the current global healthcare crisis, the evolving circumstances will probably lead to a different way of working, including more web-based collaboration and advisory methods. We are already kicking off new client projects and delivering on existing consultancy assignments through our robust online infrastructure\u201c, <\/em>says David Wells, CEO of AqualisBraemar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;At this stage, it is hard to quantify the lasting impact of COVID-19 to our trading. We have not yet experienced a significant group-wide impact on our activity level, but continued travel restrictions will inevitably affect short term business development and operations in various ways. We continue to monitor the situation closely and remain agile in response to any business disruptions that may arise. We remain confident in the significant commercial opportunities that will still manifest themselves, and believe AqualisBraemar will have a strong underlying momentum when returning to a normalized business environment, providing a solid platform for long-term growth&#8221;,<\/em> David Wells concludes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Kim Boman, CFO, AqualisBraemar ASA<br>Telephone: +47 959 63 912<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>Telephone: +47 41 61 06 05<br>Email: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar ASA<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>AqualisBraemar ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public listed company that, through its subsidiaries and associates, offers adjusting, marine, offshore and renewables consultancy services to the energy, shipping and insurance industries.

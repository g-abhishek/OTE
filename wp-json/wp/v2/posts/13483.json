The goal is to install an impressive 28GW of new installed capacity by 2050. Today, Poland does not have any offshore wind farms, but aims to have installed circa 4 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and is working on a maritime spatial plan that is intended to add additional area for offshore licensing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, offshore Poland is covered by various kinds of sediments, ranging from loam through fine\u2010grained sand and coarse sands, to gravel and stones, with sediment thickness varying between 50 and 100 metres.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cAlthough Poland can benefit significantly from a well-established local construction industry that is more than capable of producing foundations such as monopiles and piles, the geology expected at the Polish Baltic Sea areas indicates that the type of turbine foundations to be used here should be carefully assessed,\u201d<\/em> adds Sikorski.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OWC is an independent consultant offering project development services, owner\u2019s engineering and technical due diligence, and is a leading geotechnical engineer to the offshore wind sector.

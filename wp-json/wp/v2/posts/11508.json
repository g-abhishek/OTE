My job is to investigate and report on insurance claims in the Energy, Marine and Power sectors. These incidents and claims are typically complex and of high value. Having graduated with a chemical engineering degree before pursuing a career as a professional sportsman (along with reading and obtaining a master\u2019s degree), the transition into adjusting and regathering the ball from my engineering background seemed a good opportunity. Since joining AqualisBraemar, I have expanded my engineering knowledge to suit the variety of operations and challenges that we face day-to-day. This is like many of my adjuster colleagues, I just started a little older.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my five years with the company, I have gained regular market support and been appointed on offshore construction claims and a range of operational property claims. On the job training, combined with my studies for insurance exams, has helped enormously with my role and development in this niche business. We are often required to attend sites to record damage and start our investigations, or to monitor repairs, which is fascinating and a daily education. At the desk, my main function is to service our clients; this involves keeping them up to date with regular emails and calls, as well as preparing detailed technical reports, quantifying claims and presenting them for settlement. In short, as independent experts, we seek to make the claim process as smooth and transparent as possible. Sometimes there are disputes but we always try to assist with concluding matters in an amicable way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being instructed by insurers and attending site, often at very short notice, can be very exciting. The opportunity to view high-value, complex engineering installations is given to few people, and I always welcome site visits. The challenge of servicing insurers in their quest to find the cause of an incident and to give them a \u2018figure\u2019 early by asking the right questions is something I enjoy. This is tied with a constant process of managing expectations for all interested parties, whether in supporting a cost claimed by the assured or having a robust rationale of why some expenses cannot be supported. Ultimately, getting to a position where all agree on the facts and accept our recommendation for settlement is my match-winner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was a sportsman, I knew that career would end when I was way too young to \u2018retire\u2019 and I recognised the need to be prepared. Gaining the education I did and joining AqualisBraemar gave me the opportunity to use my technical skills in a unique professional environment. The juxtaposition of visits to site and desk-based work gives balance to the job and I love this contrast. I also like working in team environments, and the ability to bounce ideas off one another, to debate and resolve any issues is great. We have a very competent team who understand the benefit of our close-knit and supportive ideal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m not putting out fires, I am still involved with playing and coaching sport, particularly rugby, tennis and football. Outside of this, I have two young boys and I love watching them grow and be naughty.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The team at AqualisBraemar share the passion, vision and values for working in energy and the world\u2019s oceans, de-risking and driving the energy transition.

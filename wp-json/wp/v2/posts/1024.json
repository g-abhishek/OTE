We aim to give our clients more choice and to challenge the established players\u2019 offering. This job confirms that our business model is tailored correctly and that we have both the regional and international underwriter support,\u201d says David Wells, CEO of AqualisBraemar.<\/p>\n<p>Staff from AqualisBraemar\u2019s Dubai office last week successfully moved its first jack-up rig in India. The \u201cJindal Star\u201d, a new build MLT 116 E, was towed from Lamprell\u2019s shipyard in UAE to an ONGC platform location offshore the west coast of India. Attendance on a second Aban Offshore unit for an infield move was completed shortly afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a major leap forward in our efforts in India. One of our key differentiators is that the company consists solely of experienced personnel who have seen plenty of action offshore. This is what our customers want when they are managing high value assets and projects,\u201d adds David Wells.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar is a specialized marine and offshore engineering consultancy focusing on the shallow and deep-water offshore segments of the oil and gas industry.

I typically work up and down the coast, along with Mexico, Western Canada, Hawaii, and Alaska. I have conducted pre-risk surveys, including JH-143 surveys, P&amp;I \/ H&amp;M reactivation, ship risk review surveys. I have done some work as an expert witness, or writing expert reports. The majority of the work I am involved with is in the area of Hull and Machinery damage surveys, to attempt to determine the cause, nature and extent of damages, expected repair plans, and following the costs involved with the damage, to ensure they are fair and reasonable. I am happy to be a board member of the Marine Insurance Association of Seattle, where I have been involved with the preparation and execution of the Day of Education for the previous eight years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting thing for me is the people I get to work with. Whether it is a crew on a vessel, a shipyard\u2019s staff, other surveyors, Owner\u2019s representatives, underwriters, brokers, adjusters, or the maritime groups that I am involved with in Seattle, the people that I get to spend time with have made a huge impact on me. Getting to know people helps me to keep up to date on the changes and challenges in the industry. Through the continuing education sessions and other events, I am able to be informed on new regulations, laws, and procedures on vessels as soon as they occur.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined AqualisBraemar because of the people that I have the privilege to work with. The team at AqualisBraemar is knowledgeable, professional, and willing to help make each of us successful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am blessed to have a wife and three kids. We like to go for bike rides, kayaking, hiking, and camping. They are usually involved in a lot of sports, so we spend time watching them grow and become better at life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cI am the US West Coast engineering surveyor, based in the Seattle area.

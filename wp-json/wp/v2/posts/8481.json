Based on the corresponding installation record data, AqualisBraemar has developed an extensive database and in-depth knowledge on leg penetration predictions at different sites with challenging ground conditions. This allows us to repeatedly optimise LPA services to provide high-quality prediction and to mitigate relevant risks effectively,\u201d<\/p><cite>Reuben Segal, chief operating officer at AqualisBraemar<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leg penetration assessment (LPA) is an analytical study of the soil conditions to predict the anticipated leg penetrations&nbsp; and potential risks of jack-ups during their offshore deployment, mainly based on the ground conditions on site. The LPA is a tool for rig owners to work out their jack-up installation plan. It is also an important part of site-specific assessment of jack-ups to understand the structural integrity and capability for jack-up installed at specific sites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LPA services are provided to the clients in both offshore oil and gas as well as renewables industries, covering jack-up deployments for new offshore structures, and for maintenance and operation services for existing offshore structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cA wrong leg penetration analysis could have serious consequences, such as structural failure of jack-up units, instability or even leg damages to the jack-up. Worst case it could also lead to serious personnel injuries,\u201d <\/p><cite>Reuben Segal<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>From a commercial perspective, a wrong leg penetration analysis could have detrimental impact on project schedule due to delayed jack-up deployment as a result of unexpected installation difficulties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AqualisBraemar is a result of the recent unification between Aqualis Offshore and Braemar Technical Services.&nbsp;AqualisBraemar is a leading offshore, renewables, adjusting and marine consultancy group with service offering across all major basins.

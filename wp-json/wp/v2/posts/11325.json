There were only three suitable tidal windows for departure. The whole operation was carried out in six stages, and each phase had to be carefully planned, coordinated and executed with clockwork precision.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the challenges caused by the limited tidal window and the Covid-19 lockdown, the rig was successfully towed from the Pipavav dry dock and positioned at her drilling location in good time before onset of the Indian south-west monsoon season, when weather conditions would have delayed the operation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cUnder normal circumstances, this is a difficult undertaking given the tight tidal window and requirement to dredge the channel. There was a lot of pressure to complete this rig move before the weather closed in. AqualisBraemar is pleased to have been involved with this operation, and its success is testament to the organisation, planning and execution by ONGC. It highlights how just how important good teamwork is to any operation, particularly when constrained by today\u2019s pandemic situation. I am very proud that we were able to contribute to the operation as part of their team and that it all went so well despite the many hurdles to overcome,\u201d<\/em>&nbsp;said Rodger Dickson, group managing director \u2013 offshore, at AqualisBraemar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Kim Boman, CFO, AqualisBraemar ASA<br>Telephone: <a href=\"tel:+47 959 63 912\">+47 959 63 91<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>Telephone: <a href=\"tel:+47 41 61 06 05\">+47 41 61 06 05<\/a><br>Email: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar ASA<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>AqualisBraemar ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public listed company that, through its subsidiaries and associates, offers adjusting, marine, offshore and renewables consultancy services to the energy, shipping and insurance industries.

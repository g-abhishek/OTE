Entering Aberdeen was the obvious next step of our expansion strategy. The city is the oil and gas centre of the UK and packed with oil companies, rig operators and oil services players who constantly need support from senior engineers and mariners for challenging offshore projects and integrity problems. That is exactly what we offer,\u201d says David Wells, CEO of AqualisBraemar.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar is a specialized marine and offshore engineering consultancy focusing on shallow through to deep-water offshore segments of the oil and gas sector. Its core services include concept, FEED and basic design engineering for upgrades and conversions of jack-ups, FPSOs and rigs, transportation and installation of floating production units and integrated decks using third party equipment, marine warranty, dynamic positioning, construction supervision and due diligence services. The company also offers rig moving services, inclining experiments and deadweight surveys, decommissioning (floating and fixed), mooring design\/integrity expertise as well as experience transfer for marine renewable energy systems.<\/p>\n<p>In two years, AqualisBraemar has opened up 15 offices in 10 countries worldwide. The company currently employs 222 full time equivalent employees.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar\u2019s Aberdeen-office will be located in Granholm Village, which is on the site of the famous Grandholm Mill. It will be headed up by Martin Brown, a Chartered Naval Architect with 25 years\u2019 experience from offshore projects on the UKCS and elsewhere around the world. He has worked as a consultant for numerous years, lately for a major international marine organisation. Prior to this he worked for McDermott Marine Construction Ltd, Brown &amp; Root Limited and Saipem\/Micoperi. Recently, Mr Brown was project manager for Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s update of the organisation\u2019s mooring integrity guidelines (MIG) as well as for the tow out and moorings reconnection of the Gryphon FPSO.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar\u2019s Aberdeen-office is expected to grow, and more experienced consultants will be added to the team in due course.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will be a mix of offshore-experienced mariners and engineers who provide an integrated service. This means that we can work directly for our clients on engineering or offshore projects, or alternatively operate as an independent third party on, for example, carrying out technical due diligence or quality marine warranty services\u201d says Martin Brown, General Manager of AqualisBraemar\u2019s Aberdeen office.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAqualisBraemar mainly consists of personnel with 15-30 years\u2019 experience from marine and offshore projects. The majority have seen plenty of action offshore, which is what our customers look for when they are managing high value assets and undertaking major projects. Our plan is to utilize this experience as a foundation for long term customer relationships in Aberdeen,\u201d adds Martin Brown.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For further information, please contact:<\/p>\n<h6>Media<\/h6>\n<p>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS, tel: +47 41 61 06 05, email: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n<h6>About Aqualis ASA<\/h6>\n<p>Aqualis ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public company that, through its subsidiaries, offers marine and engineering consultancy services to the offshore oil, gas and renewable sectors globally.

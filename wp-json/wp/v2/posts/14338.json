Today, the company also has offices in South Korea and Japan and has also been involved in project developments in Vietnam. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cTom\u2019s remit is to continue growing our existing teams and establish new offices to support wind developers locally. Offshore wind is a rapidly growing industry in the Asia Pacific region, and international and regional developers operating here have welcomed our strategy of providing project development, owners engineering and technical due diligence services on the ground locally, supporting local industry development and value creation\u201d<\/em> says Will Cleverly, managing director of OWC.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Global Wind Energy Council, Asia is set to become a leader in offshore wind, with its share in the global offshore wind market expected to grow from 24 per cent in 2019 to 42 per cent in 2025 and for the rest of the decade. The council expects that the top five markets in the region for&nbsp;new installations over the next decade will be China (52GW), Taiwan (10.5GW), South Korea (7.9GW), Japan (7.4GW) and Vietnam (5.2GW).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Whittle, previously OWC\u2019s country manager in Taiwan, has worked as a project director, project manager and package manager on a number of offshore wind projects in the UK, Europe and Asia. He has significant experience in project development, floating wind, interface management, site investigations, foundation installation, cables installation and offshore construction. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whittle is also OWC\u2019s floating wind lead and sits on the floating committee of the WFO \u2013 World Forum Offshore Wind. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cWith Asia Pacific countries\u2019 massive energy transition investment plans in both floating and fixed offshore wind, this is a highly exciting region. I am glad that OWC continues its strategy of building up presence and competence close to where our clients have their projects and we look forward to reinforcing our presence in the years to come,\u201d<\/em> says Tom Whittle, OWC\u2019s Asia Pacific director.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OWC is an independent consultant offering project development services, owner\u2019s engineering and technical due diligence to the offshore renewables sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5>For further information, please contact:<\/h5>\n<p>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: <a href=\"tel:+47 41 61 06 05\">+47 41 61 06 05<\/a><br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar LOC ASA<\/h5>\n<p>AqualisBraemar LOC ASA (OSE: Aqua) offers independent adjusting, marine and offshore consultancy to the global renewables, maritime, oil and gas and power sectors.

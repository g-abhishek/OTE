When I\u2019m not attending a survey, I am writing reports for the surveyed vessels, studying casualty data. I am a technical resource for my colleagues and act as a support with any projects that are active. Also, when the opportunity arises, I dabble in public speaking about the wonderful world of marine surveying to all ears that will listen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Opportunity for discovery and limitless potential is the most exciting thing about our maritime industry. As a Bahamian, I have an innate fascination with the sea. I can say that many days of my childhood were spent looking towards the horizon and wondering about what was out there, so it\u2019s always fascinating to continue answering my own question! From Admiralty Lawyers to Z-drive manufacturers, if it\u2019s a job you can do on land there is an avenue for you to also do it at sea, so it\u2019s really great to know there is a place for anyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew surveying was my passion after A surveyor by the name of Tony Smith at American Club P&amp;I Insurance mentioned that I could combine my love for travel &amp; the shipping industry with my engineering practices, and I never looked back! I absolutely love learning new information, have a knack for working with a variety of people, and an engineering background. The only thing I was missing was a group of experienced surveyors to put the flashlight in my hand! I reached out to several surveyors for mentorship and got connected to John Walker, the Managing Director for the Americas. The rest is history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I am not working, I\u2019m making art, gardening, or exercising. I love being outdoors, so most of my off-work activities keep me outside and mentally occupied. I love plants, taking my dog on bike rides, and working with my hands. I practice photography and videography as a hobby along with abstract art, macram\u00e9 art, tapestries, resin art, and clay art. One day I intend to open an Etsy store to share some of my creations with the world!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cI assist with vessel inspections alongside experienced naval architects, ex-chief engineers, and master mariners both locally and internationally.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":11960,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[251],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Ashanti_Smiling_with_AqualisBraemar_Americas_Surveyors.jpg","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

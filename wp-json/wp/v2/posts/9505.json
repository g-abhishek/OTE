The combination has created a strong platform for developing the combined group and increasing shareholder value. The transaction is also a step forward to consolidate our industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feedback from our clients, our employees and the insurance markets has been very positive. We are already seeing the upsides of the combination in our offering to our clients, who now benefit from a broader suite of services, larger workforce and increased geographical footprint. Our goal remains to meet the increasing expectations of our industry globally and to be recognized as the \u2019go to\u2019 consultant of the shipping and energy markets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of integrating the two companies is proceeding well, and we are ahead of schedule on several fronts. We originally targeted cost synergies of USD 1.1 million, with full run rate expected by the end of 2021. In our second quarter report we raised that target to USD 2.0 million, and this quarter we further increase this to USD 2.5 million. At the end of Q3 2019 we are pleased to report that we have achieved run-rate cost synergies of USD 1.9 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our renewables arm, OWC, performed strongly in an increasingly robust, though competitive, market. Growth opportunities continue to manifest themselves, partly because the industry is becoming more global and new developers enter the market and partly due to our success in raising OWC\u2019s profile in the market. By leveraging our experience from over 30 GW of projects since 2011, we are ideally positioned to benefit from this globalisation. Following the successful opening of the Taiwan office, OWC recently established new locations in UK (Edinburgh) and Australia (Perth and Melbourne) to meet the increasing global demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color no-border-radius\" href=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/AB-Q3-2019-presentation_Final.pdf\" style=\"color:#00a3ad\">Download the presentation<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nKim Boman, CFO, AqualisBraemar ASA<br>\nTelephone: +47 959 63 912<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nEndre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: +47 41 61 06 05<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar ASA<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>\nAqualisBraemar ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public listed company that, through its subsidiaries and associates, offers adjusting, marine, offshore and renewables consultancy services to the energy, shipping and insurance industries.

However, these challenges fade in comparison to those experienced by the individuals directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sincere thanks go out to health workers across the world, who have worked tirelessly, at great personal risk, to save lives and prevent the spread of the virus.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We are proud to present record profitability and cash flow in the quarter, especially considering the challenging business environment. Through our extensive global reach, increased remote work and enhanced digital collaborations, we have maintained a high level of service to our clients. Increased focus on capital efficiency has resulted in improved cash conversion, resulting in an improved cash position despite paying dividend to our shareholders during the quarter.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>OWC, our renewables arm, continues to grow at a brisk pace delivering organic revenue growth of 70% compared to the second quarter of 2019. With several strong contract wins in 2020 so far, and an increased share of renewables related projects in our traditional business lines, we expect growth in the segment to continue. Our ambition is for 50% of our revenues to come from renewables and other ESG driven sources by 2025.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>While we expect lower activity and margins in Q3 due to seasonality and the continued impact of travel restrictions and cautious client behaviour, we remain optimistic towards the development of AqualisBraemar. The integration between Aqualis and BTS has been a success, and we have identified further potential for cost synergies to be realised over the next 12 months. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Finally, we remain committed to our strategy to return capital to our shareholders and are pleased to note that our Board of Directors signals an expectation of an additional dividend during Q4 2020.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pre-recorded audio webcast presentation of the second quarter 2020 results will be released today at 14:00 CEST.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AQUALISBRAEMAR ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PRIVATE PLACEMENT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reference is made to the stock exchange notice dated 23 November 2020 regarding AqualisBraemar ASA\u2019s (\u201cAqualisBraemar\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) agreement to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares in Neptune Midco 1 Limited from the ultimate parent company of the LOC Group, LOC Group Holdings Limited (the \u201cTransaction\u201d), the shareholders of which include pan-European investment group Bridgepoint and key employees of LOC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To partly finance the Transaction as well as for general corporate purposes, the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has resolved, subject (inter alia) to approval by the Company\u2019s extraordinary general meeting expected to be held on or about 14 December 2020 (the \u201cEGM\u201d), a private placement of 22,131,148 new shares (the \u201cOffer Shares\u201d) raising gross proceeds of approximately NOK 135 million, equivalent to approximately USD 15 million (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d). The Offer Shares correspond to approx. 31.4% of the issued and outstanding shares in the Company. The subscription price in the Private Placement of NOK 6.10 per Offer Share represents a 6.9% discount to the last closing price of NOK 6.55 per share.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Private Placement took place through a bookbuilding process managed by Clarksons Platou Securities AS, Nordea Bank abp, filial i Norge and SpareBank 1 Markets AS as Joint Lead Managers and Bookrunners (the \u201cManagers\u201d), and the application period for the Private Placement closed at 17:00 (CET) on 22 November 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both existing shareholders and new investors applied for Offer Shares in the Private Placement. Allocation of the Offer Shares by the Board, subject to final determination by the EGM, focused on criteria such as existing ownership, size and time of subscription, perceived investor quality and investment horizon. Notice of conditional allocation of the Offer Shares is expected to be sent on or about today, 23 November 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Completion of the Private Placement is subject to the approval of issuance of the Offer Shares by the EGM. Shareholders representing approximately 75.4% of the shares and share capital in AqualisBraemar have undertaken to vote in favour of, inter alia, the Private Placement at the EGM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Offer Shares are expected to be delivered to investors on or about 17 December 2020, whereof 8,047,861 Offer Shares will be settled with existing and unencumbered shares in the Company that are already listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, pursuant to a share lending agreement entered into between the Company, SpareBank 1 Markets AS (on behalf of the Managers) and Gross Management AS. The share loan will be settled with new shares in the Company following, and subject to, approval by the EGM. The shares to be redelivered to Gross Management AS will be issued on a separate ISIN and will not be tradable on the Oslo Stock Exchange until a listing prospectus has been approved by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (the \u201cNFSA\u201d), excepted around the end of January 2021 (the \u201cProspectus\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following registration of the new share capital pertaining to the Private Placement, the Company will have 92,547,583 shares outstanding, each with a par value of NOK 0.10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Board has considered the Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and Oslo B\u00f8rs&#8217; Circular no. 2\/2014 and is of the opinion that the proposed Private Placement is in compliance with these requirements. The Board is of the view that it is in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders to raise equity in order to conclude the Transaction and that such equity is raised through a private placement setting aside the pre-emptive rights of the shareholders. By structuring the transaction as a private placement, the Company was in a position to raise capital in an efficient manner in the prevailing volatile capital market, with significantly lower completion risks compared to a rights issue, and, importantly, to secure financing for the Transaction in time to satisfy a condition from the sellers for entering into the Transaction agreement. Subject to completion of the Private Placement, the Board will consider carrying out a subsequent offering raising gross proceeds of up to approximately NOK 31.5 million, equivalent to approximately USD 3.5 million, directed towards existing shareholders in the Company as of the end of trading on 20 November 2020 (and as registered in the VPS as of the end of 24 November 2020) who are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful, or would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus filing, registration or similar action who were not allocated shares in the Private Placement (the \u201cEligible Shareholders\u201d) (the &#8220;Subsequent Offering&#8221;). The Eligible Shareholders will be granted non-tradable subscription rights. The subscription period in a Subsequent Offering, if implemented, is expected to commence shortly after publication of the Prospectus. The subscription price in a potential Subsequent Offering will be equal to the subscription price in the Private Placement. Taking into consideration the time, costs and expected terms of alternative methods of the securing the desired funding, as well as the subsequent offering considered, the Board has concluded that the conclusion of the Private Placement on acceptable terms at this time is in the common interest of the shareholders of the Company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following primary insiders have been allocated shares in the Private Placement:<br>\u2022 Gross Management AS, a company controlled by Chairman of the Board Glen R\u00f8dland (4,765,574 shares)<br>\u2022 Bader Diab, Regional MD Americas (516,393 shares)<br>\u2022 Reuben Segal, COO and Board Member (295,080 shares)<br>\u2022 Mark McGurran, Group MD Marine (227,180 shares)<br>\u2022 David Wells, CEO (175,000 shares)<br>\u2022 Phil Lenox, Regional MD Asia (175,000 shares)<br>\u2022 Svein Staalen, General Counsel (175,000 shares)<br>\u2022 Haakon Brandrud, Director of Strategy and Corporate Development (175,000 shares)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the following members of LOC Group management have been allocated shares in the Private Placement:<br>\u2022 Charles Honner, AqualisBraemar, MD Adjusting Americas (175,000 shares)<br>\u2022 RV Ahilan, LOC Group, CEO (737,705 shares)<br>\u2022 Alex Harrison, LOC Group, Director Energy Services (175,000 shares)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advokatfirmaet Haavind AS has acted as legal counsel to the Company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"news-footer\"><p>For further information, please contact:<\/p>\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n<p>Dean Zuzic, CFO, AqualisBraemar ASA<br>\nTelephone: <a href=\"tel:+47 41 43 35 60\">+47 41 43 35 60<\/a><\/p>\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n<p>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: <a href=\"tel:+47 41 61 06 05\">+47 41 61 06 05<\/a><br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar ASA<\/h5>\n<p>AqualisBraemar ASA (OSE: Aqua) offers independent consultancy services to the offshore energy (oil &amp; gas and renewables), shipping and insurance industries.

It is the role of the adjuster to investigate and report on insurance claims, at AqualisBraemar we focus on the Energy, Marine and Power sectors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had previously spent nearly a decade within Oil and Gas initially as a Geologist and later as a Petroleum Engineer. I had worked for various operators and service companies focusing on sub-surface technical work. During my time in the industry, my exposure to losses was minimal, you would hear of or be a part of an event that would result in a loss, but as we were within a technical discipline working on day to day operations there was little need for us to get involved with the loss, not only because our focus remained on the forward movement of projects but also there would have been either an internal or external team dedicated to the handling of the claim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now within Adjusting, I get to see and experience the losses and also appreciate that operations and projects which are not insignificant in value benefit greatly when financial risk is reduced by adequate insurance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do believe that my background in the energy industry presents an advantage in investigating and reporting. Previous experience is drawn upon to understand the issues more rapidly, focusing on the pertinent elements and communicating what could be complex and specialised issues back to the insurers in a concise summary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is to keep the insured as informed as possible in the desire to avoid any unwanted or unforeseen outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-excites-you-the-most-about-our-industry\">What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Still being able to still remain on the peripherals of oil and gas and energy. Individuals rarely stick to a single role in their careers, either by choice or not. Over time, you tend to find yourself leaning towards or more interested in certain areas of work and sometimes you pursue them. I can honestly say loss adjusting was new to me, but I was very willing to give it a shot and fully immerse myself. The area of energy was particularly exciting as it didn\u2019t only position itself on oil and gas, but a broader spectrum encompassing onshore and offshore elements, renewables, power generation and more. Adjusting is a good mix of technical and non-technical and the added bonus of being able to get involved in something within that broader area of energy when the opportunity arises is definitely a perk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-made-you-join-aqualisbraemar\">What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AqualisBraemar was and still is in growth mode, the picture that I was painted and the options that were available really caught my attention. The opportunities to get stuck in and engaged in work assignments and the variation of those assignments is a great combination and something that keeps me stimulated and interested. Moreover, keeping employees stimulated and engaged through involvement in interesting work, benefits the company as a whole as a motivated and happy employee will add value to the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-do-you-do-when-you-are-not-working\">What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have an insufferable passion to repair, fix and renew things. Perhaps this began as a child with Lego and Meccano sets, but it has only grown in size over time. My wife and I recently moved into a house and the refurb has pretty much taken over our lives as we get stuck in as much as we physically can. Much of this can be thought of as tinkering, but it\u2019s an enjoyable hobby which helps keep our minds processing and continually learning with the added feeling of accomplishment when something is completed. I also enjoy reading comic books and try to stay current as much as I can.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am a loss adjuster in AqualisBraemar\u2019s London office.

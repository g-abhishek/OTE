I also work on elaborating dynamic positioning FMEA documents, DP operations manuals, GAP analysis, root cause analysis, risk management and activity-specific operational guidance etc. Besides that, and as an accredited OIMF-OVID inspector, I conduct OVID inspections on board all types of offshore units; OSVs, MOUs, flotel, pipe layers, accommodation barges, cable ships and so on. I am also part of the Single Voyage team, attending under own power single voyage surveys; also conducting Saudi Aramco Out of Kingdom Inspection and GAP analysis. Apart from that and depending on the workload, I assist with suitability surveys, condition surveys, and general marine consultancy based in our Abu Dhabi office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The dynamism of the day-to-day with different and exciting work scopes and projects, sometimes so challenging and demanding that they allow me to develop my experience significantly. It gives me exposure that would be very difficult to access in any other role within our industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few years of working locally as a marine superintendent, I got back in touch with some AqualisBraemar employees with whom I\u2019d worked in a previous role at another consultancy. I saw at that time the exciting moment of a new company that was gaining an excellent reputation in the industry. Seeing the enthusiasm of my ex-colleagues in their new project, I decided to apply for a job and was delighted to get a positive reply within hours. I consider myself very lucky and I do believe, after almost four and a half years, that my time in AB is yet to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, due to the workload and the number of days that I spend away from my family travelling, I have to admit that I love to spend time with them, my passion is my kid and playing football with him. When my tight schedule allows it, my passion as well is to travel back to my home country and enjoy there the weather, the lifestyle, the food and sailing races. Locally, when I\u2019m able to have some spare time, I love sailing, car racing, biking and cycling.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are driven by the idea that the best work is born from professionalism, diligence\u2026 and fun.

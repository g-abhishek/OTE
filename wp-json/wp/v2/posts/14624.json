I had no idea what I wanted to focus my studies on while in high school. All I knew is that I had an affinity for nature and an intense curiosity about natural systems and how they work \u2013 but I didn\u2019t really know what I could do with that career-wise. It was a long-time family friend who inspired me to explore Biology and Ecology as a career choice. They were working on their PhD and doing work for non-profit organizations (NGOs) in South America. \u00a0It was very interesting work, going to remote places like the Amazon, and working with local tribes and communities to assess the health and quality of local ecological systems to understand and measure the impacts relative to their uses. He was also focused on the planning and management aspects \u2013understanding how sustainable development could positively impact these systems. For me, it was fascinating, and no one I was acquainted with at the time was doing anything even remotely similar. At that age, many influences and experiences come from family \u2013 and most of mine were either teachers or running businesses. It was by chance that I was exposed to this idea of managing natural systems and planning use \u2013 I think it speaks to the importance of exposing kids in the middle and high school years to a wide variety of career choices otherwise unaccessible to them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-for-you-is-the-most-exciting-aspect-of-a-career-in-applied-science\">What for you, is the most exciting aspect of a career in applied science?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14636\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/international-day-of-women-and-girls-in-science\/attachment\/adrienne-fink\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,600\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Adrienne-Fink\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-300x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg\" alt=\"Adrienne Fink\" class=\"wp-image-14636\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg 600w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-146x146.jpg 146w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-75x75.jpg 75w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-85x85.jpg 85w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 40px) 100vw, 40px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I was always drawn to the idea of how understanding and managing our natural world could improve the quality of life for people. This is one of the reasons why, when it became an option to really focus my career path towards renewable energies, it was a no-brainer. Now that there is a deep and broad understanding that we can, and must, make changes in our energy systems to reduce GHG on a global scale, I really feel that it\u2019s important to take a critical look at the potential environmental impacts these large infrastructure projects might have, and most importantly, identify ways that we can reduce any potential impacts as we make the switch to renewables. I once worked on a U.S subsea infrastructure project that allowed scientists to perform long-term and real-time experiments and collect critical oceanography data. I was reminded by the jurisdictional agency lead that \u2018Impacts are impacts\u201d, and so regardless of the overall positive aspects of any project, there will always be impacts to the environment \u2013 it\u2019s important to acknowledge that and continually improve efforts to reduce them either through planning, process, or technology improvements. There is so much work happening in the offshore wind industry now around this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14659\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/international-day-of-women-and-girls-in-science\/attachment\/amy-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"957,957\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Amy-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-300x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14659\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg 957w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-146x146.jpg 146w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-75x75.jpg 75w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-85x85.jpg 85w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-750x750.jpg 750w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 40px) 100vw, 40px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The opportunity to continually learn and to see the processes I\u2019ve studied.

I wasn\u2019t sure that I was completely cut out for the rigours of a science degree and the career that followed, but early hands-on experiences really negated those doubts. I tried a variety of different focuses by taking hands-on field courses and lab clinics in the areas of ecology and evolutionary biology, marine biology, molecular biology and genetics, plant sciences, and became a NAUI science diver and lived aboard a small research vessel for a summer collecting reef and fish data. All of this helped me to have a broad understanding that has suited me well in my career.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-science-is-central-to-the-success-of-today-s-energy-transition-journey-what-would-you-like-to-see-take-place-to-accelerate-the-fight-for-climate-change\">Science is central to the success of today\u2019s energy transition journey\u2026 what would you like to see take place to accelerate the fight for climate change?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14636\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/international-day-of-women-and-girls-in-science\/attachment\/adrienne-fink\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,600\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Adrienne-Fink\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-300x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg\" alt=\"Adrienne Fink\" class=\"wp-image-14636\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink.jpg 600w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-146x146.jpg 146w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-75x75.jpg 75w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-85x85.jpg 85w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Adrienne-Fink-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 40px) 100vw, 40px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, although many of us are pushing every day to make sure we are doing what we can, the next generation will be left to deal with whatever state the world is in when we leave it to them. I think younger people today already have a strong understanding of what it\u2019s going to take to stop the advancement of climate change, both personally on an individual level and at the community and global level. This is a great start, and this understanding will go a long way in making sure things will continue to change in the right direction (and probably in ways I can\u2019t even imagine sitting here right now!). We need to see governments globally put this at the forefront of urgent actions. We have to unapologetically push for more ambitious green energy goals, incentivize GHG reductions, subsidize green energies and green supply chains (while at the same time cutting subsidies for fossil fuels), and invest in technology advancements toward this end.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14659\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/international-day-of-women-and-girls-in-science\/attachment\/amy-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"957,957\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Amy-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-300x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14659\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1.jpg 957w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-146x146.jpg 146w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-75x75.jpg 75w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-85x85.jpg 85w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-750x750.jpg 750w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Amy-1-480x480.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 40px) 100vw, 40px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>People need to be informed from an early age of the climate crisis, a science education is critical to this.

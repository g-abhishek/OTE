Amy has been involved with fixed and floating offshore wind projects, developing OPEX forecasts, scenario analysis and strategic O&amp;M plans. Prior to this Amy worked for BP as a geoscientist and led teams delivering projects and advised on exploration and development opportunities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy has a BSc (Hons) in Geological Sciences from the University of Leeds and MSc in Petroleum Geoscience from Imperial College London, and has been recognised for her exceptional project management skills. Amy will be based in the London OWC office.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><em>\u201cWith her strategic business development, risk &amp; asset management experience, and her market analysis skills, Amy will be a great addition to the team at these busy times.\u201d<\/em> <\/em>Said Will Cleverly, OWC managing director.<em> <em>\u201cIt underlines the fact that we continue to deliver client assignments globally at this time but have not slowed in our growth plans. With a recent BNEF study showing 4 times the investment in offshore wind globally in the first half of this year compared with last year, OWC is continuing its strategy of building great teams and opening local offices quickly in emerging markets\u201d.<\/em><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"news-footer\">For further information, please contact:<\/p>\n<h5>Investors and financial media<\/h5>\n<p>Kim Boman, CFO, AqualisBraemar ASA<br>\nTelephone: +47 959 63 912<\/p>\n<h5>Other media enquiries<\/h5>\n<p>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS<br>\nTelephone: +47 41 61 06 05<br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a><\/p>\n<h5>About AqualisBraemar ASA<\/h5>\nAqualisBraemar ASA (OSE: Aqua) offers independent consultancy services to the offshore energy (oil &#038; gas and renewables), shipping and insurance industries.

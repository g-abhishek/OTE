I deal with marine casualty surveys as well as other marine insurance matters for hull and machinery underwriters, P&amp;I clubs, shipowners, charterers and brokers. I am based in Dubai and lead a team of staff master mariner and marine engineer surveyors that are based in the Middle East. My main job is ensuring all instructions are attended to by the surveyor with the most suitable skill set for the case. All reporting to our Principals is done through me to ensure quality and consistency in reporting is maintained to the highest standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-excites-you-the-most-about-our-industry\">What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst we mostly deal in casualty work, we do carry out risk assessment surveys quite regularly. These surveys are designed to try to minimise risk to underwriters taking new tonnage on cover. However, they also serve as a platform to enable seafarers to get the necessary support from the owners\/managers with regards to supplying stores and equipment to the vessel to keep the vessels safe and at a high standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-made-you-join-aqualisbraemar\">What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined BMT Marine &amp; Offshore surveys back in 2009 and have found no reason to move through the various transitions the company has made up to date. The AqualisBraemar name remains the reference in terms of survey quality, which is something to be proud of and something that drives me to maintain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-do-you-do-when-you-are-not-working\">What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a husband and father of three daughters. Family time is important to me as I spent quite a long time away from them during my seagoing career. We enjoy exploring new places together as a family to create memories and stories to tell in later years. I enjoy working with my hands and DIY is something I enjoy doing. I am a keen motorsport fan and also enjoy taking my car to the track for a bit of a spin on occasion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The team at AqualisBraemar shares the passion, vision and values for working in energy and the world\u2019s oceans, de-risking and driving the energy transition.

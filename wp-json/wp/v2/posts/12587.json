Between 2005 and 2020 Jason worked directly in the salvage industry for leading global salvors. During this time he participated in many notable operations, leading teams in emergency response and wreck removal fields. He was also actively engaged in bodies helping shape the industry and its engagement with the wider sphere. Jason is an AqualisBraemar director based in the UK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The session chairman will be Mark McGurran, Group MD of Marine Surveying &amp; Consultancy, and the month&#8217;s casualty reports will be presented by Fena Boyle, surveyor, both from the London office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wish to attend this webinar, click&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/event.webinarjam.com\/register\/64\/4v09vsgq\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>&nbsp;to register.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Register now for our August Market Briefing Webinar for maritime &#038; insurance professionals and join our experts who will be discussing the current status of the Salvage Market and new developments in this sector.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":12596,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/shutterstock_178823165.jpg","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

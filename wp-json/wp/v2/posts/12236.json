We rely on our seafarers to provide their experience, knowledge and opinion to our clients in our daily surveying, consultancy and expert opinion work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are therefore in the very fortunate position to count many seafarers amongst our team; I have stopped using the term \u2018ex seafarer\u2019 here as we believe you that once you are a seafarer, the sea and seafaring never really leaves you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This privilege does come with its challenges, however, not least as we are in a strange position in business in that we cannot train our own staff from scratch as we do not own or operate any vessels. We therefore rely on recruiting our surveyors from the sea, directly from the maritime community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At AqualisBraemar we are always looking for seafarers to join our team who have a positive and flexible, problem-solving attitude; something with which many seafarers are blessed. Whether these seafarers have spent decades at sea or left the sea long ago to pursue careers in other sectors of the maritime industry or have 5 to 10 years\u2019 recent seagoing experience, we offer a place for the right candidates to grow and develop their careers further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12274\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/all-media\/blog\/seafarers-awareness-week\/attachment\/young-mark\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Young-Mark.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Young-Mark\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Young-Mark-255x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Young-Mark.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Young-Mark.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12274\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I myself am a seafarer and come from a seafaring family; both my parents and both my grandfathers were seafarers. I went to sea immediately after completing my GSCEs with P&amp;O Containers as an Engineering Cadet. I always knew engineering was for me as I have a love of the poetry in motion of all things mechanical, so combining that with my family tradition and the opportunity to travel the world was perfect for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This picture is me at 16 years old, being forced to do his bridge watchkeeping time while transiting the Suez Canal. I think it was around then that I confirmed to myself I had made the right choice to be an engineering cadet instead of a deck cadet!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I travelled the world on containerships such as the one pictured below, the MV ENCOUNTER BAY, one I have particularly fond memories of. Built in 1969 and having a container capacity of 1,578 TEU, she seemed enormous to me at the time, but compared to the modern, almost 24,000 TEU vessels around today she was tiny!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter\" data-effect=\"slide\"><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container\"><ul class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper\"><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"940\" height=\"624\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-12285\" data-id=\"12285\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3.jpg 940w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3-768x510.jpg 768w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3-220x146.jpg 220w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3-50x33.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3-113x75.jpg 113w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_3-723x480.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_caption gallery-caption\">My classmates (including our John Walker) in 1993 during our fire fighting course at maritime college<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-12286\" data-id=\"12286\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2-300x191.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2-768x488.jpg 768w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2-230x146.jpg 230w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2-50x32.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2-118x75.jpg 118w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2-960x610.jpg 960w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/SAW_MM_2-756x480.jpg 756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_caption gallery-caption\">MV ENCOUNTER BAY &#8211;

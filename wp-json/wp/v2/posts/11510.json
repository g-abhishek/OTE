While my primary focus is in the offshore sector, supporting rig move operations, marine warranty surveys and towage approvals, I also handle and oversee vessel condition surveys and assist in all commercial bids for the operations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy getting out of the office to meet clients and network face-to-face. I like to explore what services AqualisBraemar can provide to meet their needs, such as MWS, rig moving, marine representative, single voyage, engineering consultancy, marine consultancy and suitability surveys. This part of my role can take me to different countries to service our global clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The demanding career of a marine advisor is sometimes not readily understood and appreciated. &nbsp;Diversity, knowledge and skill to the high standards of the marine industry are required, and if you do not arrive prepared, you had better learn quickly. Not only is the expertise and skill necessary, but you need to be mentally tough, as you must often cross swords with your clients and not take a step backwards. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand that we are engaged to maintain standards and protect various interests in the operations on which we are handling. Still, the demands of the process, cost and time are forever in the mix, and holding firm can be a lonely and tough life but is exciting facing up to the challenge.&nbsp;Every day is different; there is not a day goes by without a new crisis to be averted and a new lesson to be learnt. With over 20 years\u2019 experience in the maritime industry now, and SOMWS accredited, I see every day as a challenge, not only in servicing my clients but in improving my leadership of similarly focused and high achieving staff. Overall, working with a great team of marine industry and offshore professionals, both staff and clients, provides me with satisfaction as well as benefiting my constant knowledge and expertise growth, which should excite any professional.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having made my decision to return to shore, you must look up and over the horizon to understand what roles there are for a unique set of skills, or where these skills can cross over traditional boundaries.&nbsp;I saw an exciting opportunity to join a company that was gaining an excellent reputation in the industry in an exciting, if different, environment supporting the offshore industry. I applied for a marine surveyor role and was delighted to receive a positive response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I consider myself very lucky, and&nbsp;the opportunity to work for a company with such high standards is fulfilling, with the ability to engage with international clients and colleagues who share such beliefs in maintaining if not improving on those standards and continually improving.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am simply a family man. That was ultimately a large driver on why I returned to shore, to be there and see my family grow. Travel and extended offshore attendance is a necessary burden of the job, but home is the place where I de-stress, and happiness is spending time with my family. I have to admit that I cherish every moment that I can spend time with them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The team at AqualisBraemar share the passion, vision and values for working in energy and the world\u2019s oceans, de-risking and driving the energy transition.

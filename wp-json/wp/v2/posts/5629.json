As well as being a Master Mariner, Maurice, is also known as the Lead Guitarist of the well regarded local classic rock and blues <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Roadhouse-Aberdeen-342263289497465\/?pnref=lhc\">Roadhouse Band<\/a>. Maurice joins AqualisBraemar after a seven-year period with a major Oil and Gas Operator based both in Aberdeen and in Houston, Texas. Prior to this he worked for a variety of marine consultancy and marine warranty services providers, after coming ashore in year 2000 following an initial sea-going career, which included the Royal Navy anti-submarine warfare section. While in Houston Maurice played guitar with a well-known blues and souls singer, \u201cLady D\u201d. Maurice finds that his guitar playing and teaching provides a refreshing change to the day to challenges associated with marine work.<\/p>\n<p>Martin Brown, AqualisBraemar\u2019s General Manager welcomed Maurice and commented that <em>\u201cthe timing of his appointment should fit well with the present gradual upturn in oil and gas operations combined with increased activity in renewables, decommissioning and marine operations. I am sure that the relatively close knit marine community in Aberdeen will be pleased to know that Maurice is back, in an operational support role, with his drive and experience available to assist with all types of marine matters\u201d.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Maurice will be based at AqualisBraemar\u2019s West End office where he will be part of an experienced flexible team including Naval Architects, Marine Engineers, Master Mariners and project control personnel. The Aberdeen office is part of the wider Aqualis Group, which has offices in the majority of the oil and gas capitals around the world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Media<br \/>\n<\/strong>Endre Johansen, Corporate Communications AS, tel: +47 41 61 06 05, email: <a href=\"mailto:endre.johansen@corpcom.no\">endre.johansen@corpcom.no<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Aqualis ASA<br \/>\n<\/strong>Aqualis ASA (OSE: Aqua) is a public company that, through its subsidiaries and associates, offers energy consultancy services to the oil and gas, wind and solar sectors globally.

Sandeep Sharma, Country Manager | India<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do at AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I handle the country operations for India, whereby my role entails me to liaise with clients and partners to reach newer heights. I am responsible for the day-to-day management decisions, overseeing the strategic development and executing the strategic and tactical plans of the company within the Indian region. I am also responsible for effectively managing the performance of employees to ensure deliverables in accordance with instructions, procedures and policies in a happy and conducive environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our industry is a very dynamic one, evolving and growing constantly. This sure is an exciting thing for a&nbsp;\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bmarine professional and keeps us on our toes. Heading operations for the country is a demanding position whereby, one needs to be abreast with all the industry trends and sentiments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I perceive each day as a challenge, not only in servicing my clients but improving my role in mentoring&nbsp;similarly focused and high achieving staff. Overall, working with a great team of marine industry and offshore professionals, both staff and clients, provides me with gratification as well as benefiting my constant knowledge and expertise growth, which should excite any professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you join AqualisBraemar?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After working for over 14 years at sea, through a common friend and colleague in this company, I started my career ashore in 2011 as a marine warranty surveyor and gained extensive experience in the onshore\/offshore industry. I&#8217;m an Accredited Vessel Inspector (eCMID) and Marine Warranty Surveyor for Jack-up Rig moves and presently heading India operations for AqualisBraemar. The thriving environment and a plethora of opportunities at AqualisBraemar have always drawn and nurtured me into the professional I am today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a sports and fitness enthusiast and during my free time, I love playing outdoor sports like cricket, football, squash or badminton. Apart from work-related travel, I enjoy taking biannual vacations and breaks with my family and friends. The thrill of experiencing new cultures and cuisine with my family is the most exciting! &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cI handle the country operations for India, whereby my role entails me to liaise with clients and partners to reach newer heights.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":12902,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[251],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Sandeep-helicopter.jpg","yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Meet the Team: Capt.

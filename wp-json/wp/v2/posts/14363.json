In this role, I have been working directly with Insurers and Insureds in resolving claims, primarily in the midstream and downstream energy markets. This has involved performing post-loss site inspections, evaluating Insured\u2019s claimed costs against their insurance program and facilitating consistent and effective communication between our clients (Insurers) and their customers. My education and prior work experience are in the area of Mechanical Engineering, which has afforded me opportunities to work in R&amp;D, manufacturing, and even commercialization of university research at The Ohio State University. All of these experiences have imparted to me a strong understanding and appreciation of the operations of technologically complex businesses, which I\u2019ve been able to lean on every day in my work with complex energy claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-excites-you-the-most-about-our-industry\">What excites you the most about our industry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, I get to learn new things every day. Being new to the fields of energy and insurance, I am relishing my opportunities to see first-hand the latest technologies in oil &amp; gas as well as the burgeoning renewables market. Additionally, I get to utilize skills that I\u2019ve developed in data analysis\/programming, systematic problem solving, and project management in different contexts from my previous experience. It\u2019s a great treat to realize value for our clients through the use of these tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-made-you-join-the-aqualisbraemar-loc-group\">What made you join the AqualisBraemar LOC group?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adjusting is a very new space for me, and not something I had long considered as a career path. However, in discussing the work with an old acquaintance with a similar engineering background and doing some of my own research, I became excited about the opportunity to apply my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills in a whole new way. I\u2019ve always prided myself on working with others as a team to achieve a common goal, and this position continually affords me that opportunity. I feel fortunate to have joined a company that is so committed to promoting and supporting the energy transition in all of its business lines!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-do-you-do-when-you-are-not-working\">What do you do when you are not working?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife and I are lucky to have three great kids at home that are starting to get into all sorts of sports and activities. I really enjoy coaching our twin boys\u2019 soccer and baseball teams, participating in father\/daughter dances at our daughter\u2019s dance studio, and assisting in cub scout and girl scout activities for all three. At home, I try my hand at DIY for most of our improvement projects (often not totally in line my wife\u2019s schedule expectations). Then, when we get some time to relax, our family loves cheering for our favourite Columbus and Cleveland sports teams.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am a Senior Adjuster, working out of the Columbus, Ohio office since May 2019.

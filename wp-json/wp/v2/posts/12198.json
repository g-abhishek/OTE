Over the last three decades, the area became popular in the ship-repair sector attracting vessels not only regionally but globally and with a repair portfolio of repairs of all levels of complexity. In addition, during the last ten years shipbuilding has also been developed and the order books of certain shipyards have been filled in with orders for chemical tankers, fishing boats and recently military and special purpose \/ offshore vessels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the above context, we examine the status of the shipyards in this area as well as the trends and developments in the shiprepair and shipbuilding sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be followed as usual by a review of last month\u2019s marine casualty reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The learning objectives of the presentation are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Understanding characteristics of the shipyards culture in Tuzla and Yalova<\/li><li>How shipyards compete with challenging projects under competitive pricing<\/li><li>How shipbuilding evolved in need of global supply<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Uluc Morek, who will be delivering the main technical subject, started his shipyard career as a repair engineer and has worked actively under various shipyards in Tuzla.

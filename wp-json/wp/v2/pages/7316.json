BRAEVURA\u00a9 is used to analyse both present \nscenarios and future scenarios, to investigate how the introduction of, \nfor example, a berth or a wind farm will affect the navigational risk. \nVarious vessel routes, categories, drafts and sizes can be modelled for a\n given study area. Ship to ship encounters are identified by area and by\n traffic routes and presented on a navigational chart to show high and \nlow density areas and risk hotspots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grounding risk analysis is undertaken using Monte Carlo simulation \ntechniques which perform several thousand iterations so that the \nprobability distribution of Closest Point of Approach (CPA) to the \nstructure of interest can be determined. The distribution of impact \nenergies is also calculated to assist with the efficient design of \nstructures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key modelling and analysis features of BRAEVURA\u00a9 risk analysis are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"bullets\"><li>Ship to ship collision risk<\/li><li>Ship to fixed structure allision risk<\/li><li>Grounding risk<\/li><li>Use of AIS data<\/li><li>Vessel routes and volumes<\/li><li>Present and future cases<\/li><li>Onscreen animation of encounters<\/li><li>Analysis of vessel drift behavior<\/li><li>Risk to fixed structures, moored vessels, pipelines and subsea cables<\/li><li>Modelling engine failures, steering failures and human error<\/li><li>Anchor and anchor deployment modelling<\/li><li>Incident investigation to identify parameters such as speed, heading and course<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Operational Simulation \u2013&nbsp;<\/strong>The modular setup of BRAEVURA\u00a9 allows  operational simulation to be undertaken either as a separate analysis  or as an extension of a risk assessment, thereby minimizing modelling  costs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our Ports &amp; Harbour team specialises in providing Port Capacity and Operational Simulation studies.

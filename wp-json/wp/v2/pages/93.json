This may include reviewing or making recommendations on the type of equipment to be used, proposed methods, limiting operational conditions, structural capacity, floating stability of vessels, quay strength, crane rigging capacity and proposed contingency measures for each operation. This work is performed by naval architects, structural engineers, marine surveyors and Master Mariners with many years\u2019 experience in developing, reviewing and carrying out these operations.<\/p>\n<h3>Transport &amp; Installation Approvals<\/h3>\n<p>Inspections of seafastening arrangements, cargo\u2019s structural integrity, vessel\u2019s stability and strength, voyage plans and proposed route, limiting design conditions, and the safe transportation of cargo, typically from the fabrication to installation site can be carried out. Cargo may include jackets, decks, jack-ups, semi-submersible units, process equipment and other such heavy structures and project equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Loadout, transportation and installation approvals may be prepared or reviewed for all aspects of the installation operation. Surveyors will ensure that the operation is conducted as planned and in accordance with the agreed procedures. Our Surveyors have a high level of experience in these operations and will help to ensure everything proceeds smoothly.<\/p>\n<h3>Oil Rig Consultants<\/h3>\n<p>Rig move data for the oil rig and location will be reviewed and an assessment is made of the suitability of the rig at the proposed location. Suitability surveys of the rig and towing vessels will be carried out. A towage certificate of approval is issued for the rig move once preparations have been completed and the rig is ready to start the tow.<\/p>\n<p>The Tow Master attends onboard during the rig move and will monitor jacking, transit, pre-load or anchoring from departure until the rig is safely installed at the new location. AqualisBraemar\u2019s Rig Movers, Master Mariners and engineers have the expertise to ensure operations are conducted safely.<\/p>\n<h3>Suitability Surveys<\/h3>\n<p>A range of pre-hire inspections, audits and suitability surveys on a wide range of offshore vessels are carried out. The nature of the survey may include oil company standard audits or specialists surveys to confirm that the vessel is suitable for the intended job and work to be performed. The surveyor will confirm that the vessel is fit for the intended purpose and may make recommendations to the client if necessary.<\/p>\n<h3>Witnessing Trials and Tests<\/h3>\n<p>At many stages of a project, equipment must be tested and shown to be functioning as required. AqualisBraemar surveyors are regularly called upon to provide independent verification by witnessing these trials and tests. Examples include propulsion tests, lifting, winch tests, bollard pull and jacking trials.<\/p>\n<h3>Marine Advisors<\/h3>\n<p>Our surveyors have a wealth of experience in many aspects of marine operations and can offer 3rd party independent advice on similar operations and methodology to produce the best results while keeping risk to acceptable levels. This experience is invaluable when unusual operations or alternative solutions are required.<\/p>\n<h3>Standards and Procedures<\/h3>\n<p>AqualisBraemar marine consultants normally apply the standards set forth by ISO 19901-1:2005. These internationally recognised standards apply to the design, construction and operation of offshore structures of all types used in the petroleum and natural gas industries. We also work to agreed alternative project specific standards where appropriate.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"3013\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/services\/offshore-energy-mws\/marine-consultancy\/attachment\/dsc01116-edit\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1440\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"DSC01116-edit\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-300x225.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-1024x768.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3013 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Offshore consultancy\" width=\"648\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-195x146.jpg 195w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-50x38.jpg 50w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-100x75.jpg 100w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-960x720.jpg 960w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit-640x480.jpg 640w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC01116-edit.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>AqualisBraemar provide professional offshore &#038; marine consultancy services.

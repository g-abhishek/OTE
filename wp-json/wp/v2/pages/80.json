The teams have extensive experience in a wide range of offshore activities from simple marine operations to complex and challenging offshore projects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Typical activities may include:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul class=\"bullets\">\n<li>Document reviews<\/li>\n<li>Suitability marine warranty surveys of offshore marine spreads<\/li>\n<li>Approval of towages, Heavy Lifts and installations<\/li>\n<li>Subsea operations<\/li>\n<li>Decommissioning and removal of offshore structures<\/li>\n<li>Acting as Marine Advisors to oil companies and their contractors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Underwriter\u00a0Approvals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">AqualisBraemar is well known in the insurance market by many of the key international energy underwriters. We have been approved as Marine Warranty Surveyors on projects which include offshore construction works, <a href=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/services\/transportation-and-installation-ti\/\">transportations<\/a> (including floatovers and Heavy Lift topside load-outs), <a href=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/services\/jack-up\/\">jack-up<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/services\/rig-moving\/\">rig moving<\/a> and location approvals, towages and dry transportations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Marine\u00a0Warranty\u00a0Surveyor\u00a0Role<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The MWS marine warranty surveyor role is to make reasonable endeavours to ensure that the risks associated with the warranted operations are reduced to an acceptable level in accordance with best industry practice. Marine Warranty Services may include approvals for the following operations:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"bullets\">\n<li>Ocean towages<\/li>\n<li>Barge transportations<\/li>\n<li>Unusual \/ oversized cargoes on ships<\/li>\n<li>Location Approval for MODUs<\/li>\n<li>Offshore rig move attendance onboard MODUs<\/li>\n<li>Loadout, transportation and installation of offshore platforms, topsides and sub-sea structures<\/li>\n<li>Floating construction activities, floatover, deck mating, FPSO mooring installation &amp; TLP hook-up<\/li>\n<li>Pipelay operations<\/li>\n<li>Bridge and harbor construction activities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Loadout\u00a0Approvals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The procedures, supporting engineering calculations and analyses of the operation are reviewed. Typically this will include equipment, proposed methods, limiting operational conditions, structural capacity, floating stability of vessels, quay strength, crane rigging capacity and proposed contingency measures. This work is performed by naval architects, structural engineers, marine surveyors and master mariners with many years\u2019 experience in developing, reviewing and carrying out these operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Transport\u00a0Approvals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Transport approvals address the seafastening arrangements, cargo\u2019s structural integrity, vessel\u2019s stability and strength, proposed route, limiting design conditions, and the safe transportation of cargo, typically from the fabrication to installation site. Cargo may include jackets, decks, jack-ups, semi-subs, process equipment and other such heavy structures and project equipment. Once the office review has been completed, the MWS attends to check that all arrangements are as planned and once everything is ready, the transport operation may depart. At this stage, a Certificate of Approval is issued and the progress of the voyage is monitored to the final destination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-77 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/dscn1448.jpg\" alt=\"Marine warranty services\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Installation\u00a0Approvals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The final stage following loadout and transportation is the installation phase. Detailed reviews will be performed for all aspects of the installation operation, providing advice (where appropriate) and approval of the documentation, equipment and item to be installed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The surveyor will confirm the operation is conducted as planned and in accordance with the agreed procedures, then issue a certificate of approval. Our Surveyors have a high level of experience in these operations and will help to ensure everything proceeds smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Rig\u00a0Move\u00a0Approvals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Rig move data for the rig and location will be reviewed and an assessment made of the suitability of the rig at the proposed location. A location approval will then be issued. Suitability surveys of the rig and towing vessels will be carried out. A towage certificate of approval is issued for the rig move once preparations have been completed and the rig is ready to start the tow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The MWS attends onboard during the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>rig move and will monitor jacking transit, pre-load or anchoring from departure until the rig is safely installed at the new location. AqualisBraemar\u2019s rig movers, master mariners and engineers have the expertise to ensure operations are conducted safely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-587 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/rig-moving.jpg\" alt=\"Marine warranty survey\" width=\"1632\" height=\"1224\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Suitability Marine Warranty Surveys<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Suitability surveys of the transportation and installation vessels are carried out. The surveyor will be familiar with vessel type and the work to be performed. The MWS confirms that the vessel is fit for the intended purpose and may make recommendations to the Client if necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Witnessing\u00a0Trials\u00a0and\u00a0Tests<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">At many stages of a project equipment must be tested and shown to be functioning as required. AqualisBraemar surveyors are regularly called upon to provide independent verification by witnessing these trials and tests. Examples include bollard pull tests, crane load tests and jacking trials.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Marine\u00a0Advisors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Our surveyors have a wealth of experience in many aspects of offshore marine operations and can offer 3rd party independent advice on similar operations and methodology to produce the best results while <a href=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/services\/risk-consulting\/\">keeping risk to acceptable levels<\/a>. This experience is invaluable when unusual operations or alternative solutions are required.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">Standards\u00a0and\u00a0Procedures<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">AqualisBraemar normally applies the standards set forth by ISO 19901-6: Marine Operations. These internationally recognised standards apply to the design, construction and operation of offshore structures of all types used in the petroleum and natural gas industries. We also work to agreed alternative project specific standards where appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The AqualisBraemar teams of Marine Warranty Surveyors, Engineers and Master Mariners act to protect Underwriters\u2019 interests or self-insured Clients.

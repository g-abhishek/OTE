Thereafter, the delegates were taken on a tour of the entire yard, including a walk through the bottom of the largest (500 m long) drydock, the floating dock and the flooding dock, plus all of the yard workshops. The delegates had an opportunity to board and tour a jack up rig, a VLCC and a large bulk carrier during their tour. On the third day the delegates were given a guided tour of Terminal 3 at Jebel Ali port container terminal and were able to visit the container terminal control room and the Harbour Master\u2019s control room.&nbsp; The course concluded with an afternoon visit to the yard of Mubarak marine at Dubai Maritime City, where the delegates listened to a presentation of large casualties in the area where Mubarak had been involved. The delegates also toured the 400 tonne capacity sheer legs crane, \u201cAl Amlak\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we ran this course for the first time in early 2016, we had 15 delegates covering law firms, salvors, underwriters, brokers, port authorities and ship financiers. The 2017 course had 20 attendees, whilst there were only 12 at the most recent course, reflecting tight controls on costs from the London Market, which did not send any delegates this year (10 in 2017).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The next course is intended to be run in the Autumn\/Winter of 2021.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"news-footer\">To register your interest please contact Lisa Zaman using the form below:<\/h4>\n\n\n<div role=\"form\" class=\"wpcf7\" id=\"wpcf7-f9840-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/9832#wpcf7-f9840-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"9840\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"5.3.2\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f9840-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-name\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"your-name\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-email\"><input type=\"email\" name=\"your-email\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-email wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-validates-as-email\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Your Email\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-message\"><textarea name=\"your-message\" cols=\"40\" rows=\"10\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-textarea wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Your Enquiry\"><\/textarea><\/span><\/p>\n<p><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-submit\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpcf7-response-output\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/div><\/form><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Course Summary Drydocks World Dubai, Jebel Ali Port and Mubarak Marine, together with AqualisBraemar, have organised a Ship Familiarisation Course targeted at the local and international<span class=\"excerpt-hellip\"> [\u2026]<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":9474,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"spay_email":""},"country":[],"discipline":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.8.2 -

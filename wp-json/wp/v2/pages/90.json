AqualisBraemar delivers dynamic positioning services including DP FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), DP audit, DP Assurance and DP project management.<\/h2>\n<p>AqualisBraemar has 19 offices in 14 countries, providing support to all regions of the world.<\/p>\n<p>We aim to assist our Clients in operating and validating their DP systems. Whether identifying the critical activity mode or verifying the worst case failure through DP FMEA, AqualisBraemar provides clients with independent technical reviews, to enhance safe DP operations.<\/p>\n<p>Our dynamic positioning services encompass all aspects of the DP system, from initial design consulting, procedures and documentation, proving trials, audits, incident investigation, life extension studies, maintenance and management; providing value to our clients at every step of the way.<\/p>\n<p>Our personnel are trained to recognize issues affecting DP performance and reliability. As independent consultants, we are ideally placed to provide unbiased expert advice, ensuring the best outcome for the vessel owners and DP operators.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">DP Technical Consulting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We recognize that a DP system includes the entire propulsion plant. Often a weakness in an engine cooling system compromises system capability. A faulty feedback linkage in a propeller pitch control can affect positioning. An incorrect UPS installation can compromise redundancy. AqualisBraemar personnel are able to offer a range of services, in addition to DP FMEA and proving trials to ensure the integrity of the DP system. This may include power system analysis, switchboard testing, sensor integration, ESD, Fire &amp; Gas systems etc.<\/p>\n<h3>DP Failure Modes and Effects Analysis<\/h3>\n<p>Our experienced DP Engineers and Mariners provide Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) to the marine and offshore industries.<\/p>\n<p><i>The objective of the FMEA is to identify the single point failure(s) in any system in the vessel which, if they were to occur, would cause loss of the position keeping ability of the vessel.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>DP FMEA \/ FMECA desk top studies determine the safety, reliability and redundancy of onboard systems for vessel positioning and DP marine related systems. These desk top studies look at all the individual components of the DP system, from the heading, position, wind and motion reference sensors, to the DP controller, the generation plant and finally the thrusters, in conjunction with the defined operating procedures. The audit follows a methodical approach, drawing on the experience of the engineers to effectively identify potential weaknesses in the system.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar produce comprehensive FME(C)A\u2019s, accepted by all Classification Societies, in accordance with industry standards. Our DP Personnel are experts at identifying what might go wrong within a system and presenting effective solutions. Client feedback is solicited to conform to continuous improvement objectives. Finally reports are issued following a stringent quality control process and results are conveyed to clients in a clear, concise format.<\/p>\n<h3>FME(C)A Proving Trials and DP Annual Trials<\/h3>\n<p>A trials program is developed from the FME(C)A in accordance with Class and or IMCA \/ MTS standards, to prove the conclusions of the FME(C)A. If any short falls were identified during the desk top study (FME(C)A), these can then be tested to confirm their severity. AqualisBraemar personnel then work closely with the client to find ways to control or mitigate the risk\/concern.<\/p>\n<p>Annual DP Trials carried out to IMCA M190 and M191 to prove that the DP system is fully functional, well maintained and the redundancy concept is intact.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">DP Assurance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In addition to technical studies, examining the design and capabilities of a DP System, AqualisBraemar personnel are able to perform surveys, on behalf of third parties as well as the vessel owners, to provide assurance that the condition of the DP System is as expected and that it will be suitable for the intended operation.<\/p>\n<h3>Condition and Suitability Surveys<\/h3>\n<p>Condition and Suitability Surveys are normally performed prior to chartering of the vessel and can be expected to highlight any underlying problems in a timely manner. Such surveys normally take the form of visual inspections, examining the condition of all equipment items, reviewing maintenance and service records and interviewing the vessel\u2019s DP personnel, to confirm their understanding \/ familiarity with the system that they are operating, and performing DP trials.<\/p>\n<h3>DP Capability Analysis<\/h3>\n<p>DP capability defines a DP vessel\u2019s station keeping ability under given environmental and operational conditions. DP capability analyses are generally used to establish the maximum weather conditions in which a DP vessel can maintain its position and heading for a proposed thruster configuration. Naval Architects and DP Engineers develop capability plots, using the vessels loading and motion characteristics, along with the thruster performance data, to show position keeping performance in terms of limiting wind speed envelopes, or thrust utilization envelopes, under a range of environmental conditions and thruster dispositions.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"3007\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/services\/dp-fmea-and-audit\/attachment\/diagram-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"682,784\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Diagram 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2-261x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3007 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2.jpg\" alt=\"DP FMEA\" width=\"682\" height=\"784\" srcset=\"https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2.jpg 682w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2-261x300.jpg 261w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2-127x146.jpg 127w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2-43x50.jpg 43w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2-65x75.jpg 65w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2-652x750.jpg 652w, https:\/\/aqualisbraemar.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Diagram-2-418x480.jpg 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>DP Footprint Verification<\/h3>\n<p>Although it is normal practice for a vessels DPOs to carry out footprints on a regular basis, there is sometimes a need for these to be verified by an independent third party. We conduct footprint verification for DP1, 2 and 3 vessels in line with the various thruster failures as detailed in a vessels\u2019 Capability Plots.<\/p>\n<h3>DP Incident Investigation and Root Cause Analysis<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes the unexpected happens. It then becomes important to understand what happened and how best to avoid it in the future. This requires a very specific skill set to effectively gather the information, analyse it, identify the causes and develop control measures to prevent it happening again.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar engineers and DP professionals are experienced in this process and with their background in DP assurance and consulting are well suited to providing independent investigations and root cause analysis, identifying what went wrong and how to best ensure it does not occur again. If required, they are able to provide expert witness services as well.<\/p>\n<h3>DP Operations Manual and Procedures<\/h3>\n<p>All DP vessels are required to carry a DP Operations Manual in accordance with Classification Society rules. This is a custom document specific to the subject vessel and includes information on the entire DP system, from propeller to GPS antenna &#8211; not just the DP console. Our team of mariners and engineers work with the client to produce documentation which enables the operators to understand the systems that they operate. Unit specific documentation will include maintenance procedures and check lists.<\/p>\n<h3>DP Operational Marine Risk Management<\/h3>\n<p>Identification and management of marine process risk exposure is a key focus on every offshore project. The industry continues to experience DP near miss incidents and incidents with consequences on a frequent basis.<\/p>\n<p>AqualisBraemar DP personnel have the experience and expertise to assist in developing focused risk mitigation in the key safety areas of station keeping and vessel integrity.<\/p>\n<p>Using WSOG \/ ASOG &amp; AMOG decision support tools, AqualisBraemar personnel can assist in developing actions and procedures that are activity specific, vessel specific and area specific, linking equipment and people to the planned marine operations.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\">DP Project Management<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We provide yard teams to represent and work with our Clients throughout the construction or conversion of an offshore asset. Using DP specialists, we are able to perform design reviews, machinery and equipment purchase order and specification reviews, in addition to providing guidance on the development and implementation of project execution plans.<\/p>\n<p>We can also monitor work progress, factory acceptance tests, attend audits of sub-contractors facilities, plus monitor quality control and testing activities throughout the construction and final commissioning stages. Finally we provide attendance during sea trials and follow-up on all close-out documentation. Ensuring project success, through close co-operation at every stage.<\/p>\n<h3>Design Review<\/h3>\n<p>From the conception of a new build vessel, we can provide our clients with a detailed design review to uncover potential failures in the system design. The FMEA process begins with the design stage. Identification of design limitations can save costly alterations in the construction stage.<\/p>\n<h3>New Build Project Management<\/h3>\n<p>The decision to build a new vessel with the associated costs involved can be a daunting one. We assist our clients by taking on the Project Management of the new build on their behalf based on our wealth of New Build experience from our DP Engineers. Acting on behalf of our clients we attend to all aspects of the new build project management.<\/p>\n<h3>Conversion Project Management<\/h3>\n<p>Vessel owners may be considering upgrade of the DP system, this might just be the upgrade of certain components or perhaps from DP Class II to Class III. In these circumstances AqualisBraemar can provide a Gap Analysis to identify what changes need to be made and the most effective means of accomplishing them.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We provide an experienced multidisciplinary team of engineering and operational resources to support the DP industry.
